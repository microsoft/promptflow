3) **Rating:** 3
   **Review:** I have mixed feelings about the CompactCook Camping Stove. On one hand, it's lightweight and easy to assemble. However, I found the heat output to be a bit underwhelming, especially when trying to boil water quickly. The stability is decent, but I would have liked to see better wind resistance.

   **Review:** I've been using the CompactCook Camping Stove for a few camping trips now, and overall, it has performed well. The construction is solid, and it feels durable.
