## Caution:

1. **Do not use the boots for activities they are not designed for:** Avoid using the TrekReady Hiking Boots for activities such as running, rock climbing, or any other sports where specialized footwear is required. These boots are specifically designed for hiking purposes.

2. **Do not submerge the boots in water:** While the boots are water-resistant, they are not fully waterproof. Avoid submerging them in water or wearing them in extremely wet conditions, as it may compromise their performance and cause damage.

3. **Do not use harsh chemicals for cleaning:** Avoid using harsh chemicals, solvents, or abrasive cleaners when cleaning the boots. Instead, use mild soap and water to gently clean any dirt or stains. Harsh chemicals can damage the materials and affect the performance of the boots.

4. **Do not expose the boots to extreme temperatures:** Avoid exposing the boots to extreme heat or cold for extended periods. Extreme temperatures can affect the integrity of the materials and potentially damage the boots. Store them in a cool and dry place when not in use.

5. **Do not ignore signs of wear and tear:** Regularly inspect your TrekReady Hiking Boots for any signs of wear and tear, such as frayed laces, worn-out soles, or loose stitching. If you notice any damage, it is recommended to repair or replace the boots to maintain their performance and safety.

6. **Do not ignore proper fit and sizing:** Ensure that you choose the correct size and fit for your feet when purchasing the TrekReady Hiking Boots. Wearing ill-fitting boots can lead to discomfort, blisters, and potential foot injuries. Take the time to try them on and make necessary adjustments for a proper fit.

7. **Do not neglect proper maintenance:** Proper maintenance is essential to prolong the lifespan of your TrekReady Hiking Boots. Regularly clean and dry the boots after each use, store them in a suitable environment, and follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer.

8. **Do not disregard safety precautions:** While the TrekReady Hiking Boots provide support and protection, they do not guarantee immunity from accidents or injuries. Always exercise caution and follow proper hiking safety guidelines, such as using trekking poles, wearing appropriate clothing, and being aware of your surroundings.

By keeping these "not-to-do" points in mind, you can ensure the optimal performance, durability, and safety of your TrekReady Hiking Boots.
