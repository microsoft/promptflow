## Caution:

1. **Do not expose to open flames or high heat sources:** The Summit Breeze Jacket is not fire-resistant. Keep it away from open flames, stoves, heaters, or any high heat sources to prevent damage to the jacket and potential injury.

2. **Avoid sharp objects:** Be cautious around sharp objects that can puncture or tear the jacket, such as thorns, branches, or sharp tools. Avoid contact to prevent damage to the fabric.

3. **Do not use harsh chemicals:** Avoid using harsh chemicals, solvents, or bleach when cleaning the Summit Breeze Jacket. These substances can damage the fabric, zippers, or other components of the jacket. Instead, follow the recommended care instructions provided in the user manual.

4. **Do not store the jacket when wet or damp:** Before storing the jacket, ensure that it is completely dry. Storing the jacket when wet or damp can lead to the growth of mold, mildew, and unpleasant odors. Hang it up or lay it flat in a well-ventilated area until it is fully dry.

5. **Avoid excessive abrasion or friction:** While the Summit Breeze Jacket is designed to be durable, excessive rubbing or friction against rough surfaces can cause premature wear or damage. Avoid continuous contact with abrasive materials to maintain the jacket's integrity.

6. **Do not iron or expose to high heat:** The Summit Breeze Jacket should not be ironed or exposed to high heat, including direct sunlight for extended periods. High heat can damage the fabric and affect its performance. If the jacket becomes wrinkled, use a low-heat setting or gently steam to remove wrinkles.

7. **Avoid storing in compressed or tight spaces:** When not in use, store the Summit Breeze Jacket in a well-ventilated area with enough space to prevent excessive compression. Avoid tightly packing or crushing the jacket, as it may affect its loft, insulation, and overall performance.

8. **Do not use fabric softeners:** Fabric softeners can leave residue on the jacket's fabric, which can reduce its breathability and water repellency. Avoid using fabric softeners during washing or drying.

9. **Avoid prolonged exposure to extreme weather conditions:** While the Summit Breeze Jacket offers weather protection, it is not intended for prolonged exposure to extreme weather conditions. In severe weather, seek appropriate shelter or layer the jacket with additional protective gear for optimal comfort and safety.

10. **Do not alter or modify the jacket:** Altering or modifying the Summit Breeze Jacket, such as adding or removing parts, can compromise its performance, fit, and warranty coverage. Avoid making any unauthorized modifications to ensure the jacket retains its intended functionality.

These cautionary points will help you use and maintain the Summit Breeze Jacket effectively while avoiding potential issues or damage.
