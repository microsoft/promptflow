      What is the role of ribosomes?\ncorrect answer: Ribosomes are cellular structures
      responsible for protein synthesis. They interpret the genetic information carried

      answer: Ribosomes participate in carbohydrate breakdown by removing nutrients

      answer: The Titanic sank after it struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage
      in 1912. The impact caused the ship''s hull to breach, allowing water to flood
      into the vessel. The ship''s design, lifeboat shortage, and lack of timely rescue
      efforts contributed to the tragic loss of life.\npredicted answer: The sinking
      of the Titanic was a result of a large iceberg collision. This caused the ship
      to take on water and eventually sink, leading to the death of many passengers
      due to a shortage of lifeboats and insufficient rescue attempts.\nstars: 2\n\nquestion:
      What causes seasons on Earth?\ncorrect answer: Seasons on Earth are caused by
      the tilt of the Earth''s axis and its revolution around the Sun. As the Earth
      orbits the Sun, the tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive varying
      amounts of sunlight, resulting in changes in temperature and weather patterns.\npredicted
      answer: Seasons occur because of the Earth''s rotation and its elliptical orbit
      around the Sun. The tilt of the Earth''s axis causes regions to be subjected
      to different sunlight intensities, which leads to temperature fluctuations and
      alternating weather conditions.\nstars: 3\n\nquestion: How does photosynthesis
      work?\ncorrect answer: Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants and
      some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. This occurs
      as light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, and then carbon dioxide and water
      are converted into glucose and oxygen through a series of reactions.\npredicted
      answer: In photosynthesis, sunlight is transformed into nutrients by plants
      and certain microorganisms. Light is captured by chlorophyll molecules, followed
      by the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen through
      multiple reactions.\nstars: 4\n\nquestion: What are the health benefits of regular
