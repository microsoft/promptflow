      five stars using the following rating scale:\nOne star: the answer completely
      lacks coherence\nTwo stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence\nThree stars:
      the answer is partially coherent\nFour stars: the answer is mostly coherent\nFive
      stars: the answer has perfect coherency\n\nThis rating value should always be
      an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or
      4 or 5.\n\nquestion: What is your favorite indoor activity and why do you enjoy
