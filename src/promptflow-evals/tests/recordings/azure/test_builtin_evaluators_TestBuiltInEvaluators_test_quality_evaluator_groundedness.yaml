      will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality
      of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate
      evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric. You should return a single
      integer value between 1 to 5 representing the evaluation metric. You will include
      no other text or information."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You will be presented
      with a CONTEXT and an ANSWER about that CONTEXT. You need to decide whether
      the ANSWER is entailed by the CONTEXT by choosing one of the following rating:\n1.
      5: The ANSWER follows logically from the information contained in the CONTEXT.\n2.
      1: The ANSWER is logically false from the information contained in the CONTEXT.\n3.
      an integer score between 1 and 5 and if such integer score does not exist, use
      1: It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without
      further information. Read the passage of information thoroughly and select the
      correct answer from the three answer labels. Read the CONTEXT thoroughly to
      ensure you know what the CONTEXT entails. Note the ANSWER is generated by a
      computer system, it can contain certain symbols, which should not be a negative
      factor in the evaluation.\nIndependent Examples:\n## Example Task #1 Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\":
      \"Some are reported as not having been wanted at all.\", \"QUESTION\": \"\",
      \"ANSWER\": \"All are reported as being completely and fully wanted.\"}\n##

      television shows appeared during the month of September. Five of the shows were
      sitcoms, three were hourlong dramas, and two were news-magazine shows. By January,
      only seven of these new shows were still on the air. Five of the shows that
      remained were sitcoms.\", \"QUESTION\": \"\", \"ANSWER\": \"At least one of
      the shows that were cancelled was an hourlong drama.\"}\n## Example Task #2
      Output:\n5\n## Example Task #3 Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\": \"In Quebec, an allophone
      is a resident, usually an immigrant, whose mother tongue or home language is
      neither French nor English.\", \"QUESTION\": \"\", \"ANSWER\": \"In Quebec,
      an allophone is a resident, usually an immigrant, whose mother tongue or home
      language is not French.\"}\n## Example Task #3 Output:\n5\n## Example Task #4
