      will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality
      of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate
      evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric. You should return a single
      integer value between 1 to 5 representing the evaluation metric. You will include
      no other text or information."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Equivalence, as
      a metric, measures the similarity between the predicted answer and the correct
      answer. If the information and content in the predicted answer is similar or
      equivalent to the correct answer, then the value of the Equivalence metric should
      be high, else it should be low. Given the question, correct answer, and predicted
      answer, determine the value of Equivalence metric using the following rating
      scale:\nOne star: the predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct
      answer\nTwo stars: the predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct
      answer\nThree stars: the predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct
      answer\nFour stars: the predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer\nFive
      stars: the predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer\n\nThis
      rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced
      should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n\nThe examples below show the Equivalence
      score for a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.\n\nquestion:
      What is the role of ribosomes?\ncorrect answer: Ribosomes are cellular structures
      responsible for protein synthesis. They interpret the genetic information carried
      by messenger RNA (mRNA) and use it to assemble amino acids into proteins.\npredicted
      answer: Ribosomes participate in carbohydrate breakdown by removing nutrients
      from complex sugar molecules.\nstars: 1\n\nquestion: Why did the Titanic sink?\ncorrect
      answer: The Titanic sank after it struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage
      in 1912. The impact caused the ship''s hull to breach, allowing water to flood
      into the vessel. The ship''s design, lifeboat shortage, and lack of timely rescue
      efforts contributed to the tragic loss of life.\npredicted answer: The sinking
      of the Titanic was a result of a large iceberg collision. This caused the ship
      to take on water and eventually sink, leading to the death of many passengers
      due to a shortage of lifeboats and insufficient rescue attempts.\nstars: 2\n\nquestion:
      What causes seasons on Earth?\ncorrect answer: Seasons on Earth are caused by
      the tilt of the Earth''s axis and its revolution around the Sun. As the Earth
      orbits the Sun, the tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive varying
      amounts of sunlight, resulting in changes in temperature and weather patterns.\npredicted
      answer: Seasons occur because of the Earth''s rotation and its elliptical orbit
      around the Sun. The tilt of the Earth''s axis causes regions to be subjected
      to different sunlight intensities, which leads to temperature fluctuations and
      alternating weather conditions.\nstars: 3\n\nquestion: How does photosynthesis
      work?\ncorrect answer: Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants and
      some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. This occurs
      as light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, and then carbon dioxide and water
      are converted into glucose and oxygen through a series of reactions.\npredicted
      answer: In photosynthesis, sunlight is transformed into nutrients by plants
      and certain microorganisms. Light is captured by chlorophyll molecules, followed
      by the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen through
      multiple reactions.\nstars: 4\n\nquestion: What are the health benefits of regular
      exercise?\ncorrect answer: Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight,
      increase muscle and bone strength, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
      It also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and improving overall
      mood.\npredicted answer: Routine physical activity can contribute to maintaining
      ideal body weight, enhancing muscle and bone strength, and preventing chronic
      illnesses. In addition, it supports mental health by alleviating stress and
      augmenting general mood.\nstars: 5\n\nquestion: Tokyo is the capital of which
      country?\ncorrect answer:Japan\npredicted answer: Japan\nstars:"}], "model":
