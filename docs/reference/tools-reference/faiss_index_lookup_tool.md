# Faiss Index Lookup

Faiss Index Lookup is a tool tailored for querying within a user-provided Faiss-based vector store. In combination with our Large Language Model (LLM) tool, it empowers users to extract contextually relevant information from a domain knowledge base.

## Requirements
- pip install promptflow-vectordb[azure]

  For Azure AI cloud users, the tool is installed in default image, you can use the tool without extra installation.
## Prerequisites
### For Azure AI cloud users,
  - step 1. Prepare an accessible path on Azure Blob Storage. Here's the guide if a new storage account needs to be created:  [Azure Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal).
  - step 2. Create related Faiss-based index files on Azure Blob Storage. We support the LangChain format (index.faiss + index.pkl) for the index files, which can be prepared either by employing our promptflow-vectordb SDK or following the quick guide from [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/faiss). Please refer to the instructions of <a href="https://aka.ms/pf-sample-build-faiss-index" target="_blank">An example code for creating Faiss index</a> for building index using promptflow-vectordb SDK.
  - step 3. Based on where you put your own index files, the identity used by the promptflow runtime should be granted with certain roles. Please refer to [Steps to assign an Azure role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps):

      | Location | Role |
      | ---- | ---- |
      | workspace datastores or workspace default blob | AzureML Data Scientist |
      | other blobs | Storage Blob Data Reader |

### For local users,
  - Create Faiss-based index files in the local path by following the above step 2.

## Inputs

The tool accepts the following inputs:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| path | string | URL or path for the vector store.<br><br>local path (supports only run locally):<br>`<local_path_to_the_index_folder>`<br><br> blob URL format:<br>https://`<account_name>`.blob.core.windows.net/`<container_name>`/`<path_and_folder_name>`.<br><br>AML datastore URL format:<br>azureml://subscriptions/`<your_subscription>`/resourcegroups/`<your_resource_group>`/workspaces/`<your_workspace>`/data/`<data_path>`<br><br>public http/https URL (for public demonstration):<br>http(s)://`<path_and_folder_name>` | Yes |
| vector | list[float] | The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by the LLM tool. | Yes |
| top_k | integer | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3. | No |

## Outputs

The following is an example for JSON format response returned by the tool, which includes the top-k scored entities. The entity follows a generic schema of vector search result provided by our promptflow-vectordb SDK. For the Faiss Index Search, the following fields are populated:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| text | string | Text of the entity |
| score | float |  Distance between the entity and the query vector |
| metadata | dict | Customized key-value pairs provided by user when create the index |
