If Ariel asked, \"What do humans do all day?\" this enchanted collection wouldn't just give a garbled Scuttle-like answer. It could tell her stories, explain concepts, even write a new song about human life, all based on the enormous amount of information it holds. It's \"large\" because of how much information it has, like all the water in the ocean. It's about \"language\" because it deals with words and communication, like Ariel longing to speak with humans. And it's a \"model\" because it's a specific magical way (like one of Ursula's potions, but for knowledge) to organize and use all that information to talk back and create new things.",
