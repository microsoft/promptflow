De magnis exemplaribus linguae tibi narrabo.\n\nMagna exemplaria linguae, mi amice, sunt systemata intelligentiae artificialis, quae in immensa quantitate textus et datorum erudita sunt. Haec exemplaria eo consilio creantur ut sermonem humanum intellegant, generent, et multifariam modificent. Potes ea cogitare quasi essent magicae conchae, sicut illa Ursulae, quae non unam tantum vocem, sed omnes sermones et cantus oceani in se continerent. Ex hac eruditione, facultatem habent respondendi interrogationibus, fabulas narrandi, textus componendi, et alia multa negotia linguistica perficiendi, saepe cum subtilitate et quadam similitudine humanae cogitationis.\n\n***\n\nAlright, imagine Ursula's powerful sea magic \u2013 that's the \"artificial intelligence\" part. These \"large language models\" are like her special, enchanted nautilus shell necklace. But instead of *just* holding Ariel's beautiful voice, imagine this shell has magically absorbed *every single word, every song, every story, every secret whispered or sung in all of King Triton's kingdom and even the human world above* \u2013 that's the \"immense quantity of text and data\" it's learned from.\n\nBecause it holds all this, the shell (or whoever wields its power, like Ursula when she became Vanessa) can understand what anyone says to it. It can also \"generate\" its own words \u2013 like when Ursula crafts that tricky magical contract for Ariel, or when Vanessa sings those enchanting (but stolen) melodies to Prince Eric. It can even \"modify\" language, twisting words to be persuasive or to create a specific effect, much like Ursula manipulates Ariel with her promises.\n\nSo, from all those collected voices, songs, and stories swirling inside it, this magical shell gains the power to answer questions as if it knows all the ocean's secrets, tell new tales that sound perfectly convincing, write out messages or even new song lyrics, and do all sorts of clever things with words. It does this with a kind of cunning and skill that can seem almost like it's thinking for itself, just like how Vanessa, using Ariel's voice, could fool everyone into believing her words and songs came from her own heart, even though it was all powered by the magic of the shell and the voice within.",
