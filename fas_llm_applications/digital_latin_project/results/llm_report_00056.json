You are fluent in Latin, including authentic classical Latin style and tone, and you have an expert understanding of Latin grammatical structures. You use your knowledge to help Latin instructors simplify classical Latin passages so they are understandable for students who have finished two years of college Latin.\n\nYour goal is to generate a grammatically simpler version of a Latin passage provided by the instructor.\n\nAlthough you should interact with the instructor in English, you should not translate the provided Latin passage into English.\n\nHere is the process you should follow:\n\n1. Analyze the provided Latin text to identify key ideas and important details. Make sure to identify important context so you can preserve it in the simplified passage. Pay particular attention to dialog, noting who is speaking, who they are speaking to, and the subjects and objects of each statement.\n2. Rephrase the original Latin in the passage into simpler Latin, using grammar and high-frequency vocabulary appropriate for second-year Latin students. In particular, follow these rules when simplifying the passage:\n    - Do not omit any key ideas or important details.\n    - Retain all of the important context from the original passage.\n    - Do not add any new information to the passage. \n    - Do not include more than two dependent/subordinate clauses per sentence.\n    - If the original passage includes any of the following forbidden grammatical structures, replace them with simpler structures that are not forbidden:\n        - subjunctive mood verbs\n        - gerunds\n        - gerundives\n        - supines\n        - impersonal use of the passive voice\n        - double dative construction\n    - When you simplify the passage, do not add any of the forbidden grammatical structures listed above. \n3. Before providing your response, compare the original passage to the simplified version. Verify that all the key ideas and context have been retained. Pay special attention to dialog, making sure that the speaker, listener, subjects, and objects of all dialog are the same as in the original passage. If they are not, revise the simplified passage so it preserves the key ideas and context from the original passage.\n4. Before providing your response, check the simplified passage and confirm that it does not contain any of the forbidden grammatical structures listed above. If the passage still contains any of the forbidden grammatical structures, rephrase those parts of the passage so they do not use any of the forbidden structures.\n5. Present your output in the following form:\n    - Display, \"Here is the simplified passage:\"\n    - Print the simplified passage. \n    - After printing the simplified passage, describe the changes you made. Give each line or sentence in the original passage along with its simplification, and then briefly summarize the changes you made when you simplified the original line or sentence.\n\n\nWorked Example:\n\nHere is an example of an appropriate simplification. The original passage was: \"post eius mortem nihilo minus Helvetii id quod constituerant facere conantur, ut e finibus suis exeant. Ubi iam se ad eam rem paratos esse arbitrati sunt, oppida sua omnia, numero ad duodecim, vicos ad quadringentos, reliqua privata aedificia incendunt;  frumentum omne, praeter quod secum portaturi erant, comburunt, ut domum reditionis spe sublata paratiores ad omnia pericula subeunda essent; trium mensum molita cibaria sibi quemque domo efferre iubent. Persuadent Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis finitimis, uti eodem usi consilio oppidis suis vicisque exustis una cum iis proficiscantur\".\n\nHere is a simplified version of this passage that is appropriate for second-year Latin students: \"post eius mortem nihilominus Helvetii id consilium, quod constituerant, facere conantur. id est, e finibus suis exire conantur. ubi iam se paratos esse arbitrati sunt, oppida sua omnia (circa duodecim), vicos (circa quadringentos), reliqua privata aedificia incendunt.  frumentum omne, praeter id quod secum portaturi erant, incendunt.  spe domum reditionis sublata, putant se futuros esse paratiores subire omnia pericula. iubent quemque sibi cibaria trium mensum domo effere iubent. persuadent finitimis gentibus, Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis, qui eodem consilio uti constituunt. oppidis suis vicisque incensis, una cum Helvetiis proficiscentur\".",

                            "text": "Here is the simplified passage:\n\n**Venus:**\nSed ego sum incerta de fatis. Fortasse Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Trojanis. Aut fortasse Iuppiter approbat hos populos se miscere et foedera facere inter se. Tu es coniunx Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius precibus tuis temptare. Perge, ego te sequar.\u201d\n\n**Juno:**\nTum regia Iuno sic respondit: \u201cHic labor erit meus. Nunc consilium meum tibi paucis verbis monstrabo. Attende! Hoc consilium est de re quae nunc instat. Aeneas et miserrima Dido una parant ire in nemus cras, ubi Sol primum ascendet et mundum radiis suis monstrabit. In nemore volunt venari.\u201d\n\nHere are the changes I made:\n\n1.  **Original:** `sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam / esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis, / miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi.`\n    **Simplified:** `Sed ego sum incerta de fatis. Fortasse Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Trojanis. Aut fortasse Iuppiter approbat hos populos se miscere et foedera facere inter se.`\n    **Changes:**\n    *   The original first sentence, spanning three lines, expresses Venus's uncertainty about Jupiter's plans using subjunctive verbs in conditional/indirect question clauses.\n    *   The passive construction `incerta feror` (I am carried uncertain) was changed to the simpler active `ego sum incerta` (I am uncertain).\n    *   The complex conditional structure with subjunctive verbs (`velit`, `probet`) was broken into two shorter, declarative sentences. Uncertainty is now expressed using `fortasse` (perhaps) with indicative verbs (`vult`, `approbat`), avoiding the subjunctive mood.\n    *   `Troiaque profectis` (for those having set out from Troy) was simplified to `Trojanis` (for the Trojans).\n    *   The passive infinitive `misceri` (for peoples to be mixed) was changed to an active construction with a reflexive pronoun: `hos populos se miscere` (for these peoples to mix themselves).\n    *   The passive infinitive `foedera iungi` (for treaties to be joined) was changed to an active construction `foedera facere inter se` (to make treaties among themselves).\n\n2.  **Original:** `tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando.`\n    **Simplified:** `Tu es coniunx Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius precibus tuis temptare.`\n    **Changes:**\n    *   `tu coniunx` (you, his wife) was expanded slightly to `Tu es coniunx Iovis` (You are Jupiter's wife) for clarity, explicitly naming Jupiter who was referred to in the previous sentence. `eius` (his) refers back to Jupiter.\n    *   `fas (est)` (it is divinely right) was replaced with `licet` (it is permitted/allowed), a more common word.\n    *   The ablative gerund `precando` (by praying), indicating means, was replaced by the noun phrase `precibus tuis` (with your prayers) in the ablative of means.\n\n3.  **Original:** `perge, sequar.\u201d`\n    **Simplified:** `Perge, ego te sequar.\u201d`\n    **Changes:**\n    *   The imperative `Perge` (Go on) was retained as it is simple.\n    *   The future indicative `sequar` (I will follow) was retained. The pronouns `ego` (I) and `te` (you) were added for clarity of the subject and object, though the verb form itself is unchanged.\n\n4.  **Original:** `tum sic excepit regia Iuno:`\n    **Simplified:** `Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:`\n    **Changes:**\n    *   The verb `excepit` (she took up/replied) was replaced with `respondit` (she replied), a more common verb for dialogue.\n\n5.  **Original:** `\u201cmecum erit iste labor.`\n    **Simplified:** `\u201cHic labor erit meus.\u201d`\n    **Changes:**\n    *   The phrase `mecum erit iste labor` (that task will be with me/my responsibility) was rephrased to `Hic labor erit meus` (This task will be mine) for a more direct and common expression. `iste` (that of yours/that) was changed to `hic` (this).\n\n6.  **Original:** `nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo.`\n    **Simplified:** `Nunc consilium meum tibi paucis verbis monstrabo. Attende! Hoc consilium est de re quae nunc instat.`\n    **Changes:**\n    *   The original sentence contains a complex indirect question (`qua ratione ... possit`) which includes a subjunctive verb (`possit`) and an impersonal passive infinitive (`confieri` - to be accomplished). This structure was eliminated.\n    *   Juno now makes a direct statement of her intention: `Nunc consilium meum tibi paucis verbis monstrabo` (Now I will show you my plan in a few words). `docebo` (I will teach) was changed to `monstrabo` (I will show/explain).\n    *   The parenthetical imperative `(adverte)` (pay attention) was made into a standalone, direct command: `Attende!` (Pay attention!).\n    *   `quod instat` (that which is at hand/urgent) was rephrased as part of a simpler relative clause in the sentence: `Hoc consilium est de re quae nunc instat` (This plan is about the matter which is now at hand).\n\n7.  **Original:** `venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.`\n    **Simplified:** `Aeneas et miserrima Dido una parant ire in nemus cras, ubi Sol primum ascendet et mundum radiis suis monstrabit. In nemore volunt venari.`\n    **Changes:**\n    *   The original long sentence, describing Aeneas and Dido's preparation for the hunt and its timing, was restructured into two simpler sentences.\n    *   The supine `venatum` (to hunt), which expresses purpose, was replaced. The purpose is now stated in a separate sentence: `In nemore volunt venari` (In the grove they want to hunt), using `volo` + infinitive, which is a common way to express intention.\n    *   The enclitic `-que` in `unaque` (and ... together) was written out as `et ... una` with the conjunction `et` joining Aeneas and Dido. The important descriptive `miserrima Dido` (most unhappy Dido) was retained.\n    *   The temporal clause `ubi primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem` (when Titan tomorrow has brought forth the first risings and with his rays has uncovered the world) was simplified:\n        *   `cras` (tomorrow) was made explicit, derived from `crastinus ortus` (tomorrow's rising).\n        *   `Titan` (the Sun god) was changed to `Sol` (Sun), a more common term.\n        *   The future perfect indicative verbs `extulerit` (will have brought forth) and `retexerit` (will have uncovered) were replaced with simpler future indicative verbs: `ascendet` (will rise) and `monstrabit` (will show).\n        *   `primos ortus` (first risings) was simplified to the adverb `primum` (first, at first).\n        *   `orbem` (the orb/world) was changed to `mundum` (the world)."
