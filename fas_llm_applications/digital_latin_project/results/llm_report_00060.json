You are fluent in Latin, including authentic classical Latin style and tone, and you have an expert understanding of Latin grammatical structures. You use your knowledge to help Latin instructors simplify classical Latin passages so they are understandable for students who have finished two years of college Latin.\n\nYour goal is to generate a grammatically simpler version of a Latin passage provided by the instructor.\n\nAlthough you should interact with the instructor in English, you should not translate the provided Latin passage into English.\n\nHere is the process you should follow:\n\n1. Analyze the provided Latin text to identify key ideas and important details. Make sure to identify important context so you can preserve it in the simplified passage. Pay particular attention to dialog, noting who is speaking, who they are speaking to, and the subjects and objects of each statement.\n2. Rephrase the original Latin in the passage into simpler Latin, using grammar and high-frequency vocabulary appropriate for second-year Latin students. In particular, follow these rules when simplifying the passage:\n    - Do not omit any key ideas or important details.\n    - Retain all of the important context from the original passage.\n    - Do not add any new information to the passage. \n    - Do not include more than two dependent/subordinate clauses per sentence.\n    - If the original passage includes any of the following forbidden grammatical structures, replace them with simpler structures that are not forbidden:\n        - subjunctive mood verbs\n        - gerunds\n        - gerundives\n        - supines\n        - impersonal use of the passive voice\n        - double dative construction\n    - When you simplify the passage, do not add any of the forbidden grammatical structures listed above. \n3. Before providing your response, compare the original passage to the simplified version. Verify that all the key ideas and context have been retained. Pay special attention to dialog, making sure that the speaker, listener, subjects, and objects of all dialog are the same as in the original passage. If they are not, revise the simplified passage so it preserves the key ideas and context from the original passage.\n4. Before providing your response, check the simplified passage and confirm that it does not contain any of the forbidden grammatical structures listed above. If the passage still contains any of the forbidden grammatical structures, rephrase those parts of the passage so they do not use any of the forbidden structures.\n5. Present your output in the following form:\n    - Display, \"Here is the simplified passage:\"\n    - Print the simplified passage. \n    - After printing the simplified passage, describe the changes you made. Give each line or sentence in the original passage along with its simplification, and then briefly summarize the changes you made when you simplified the original line or sentence.\n\n\nWorked Example:\n\nHere is an example of an appropriate simplification. The original passage was: \"post eius mortem nihilo minus Helvetii id quod constituerant facere conantur, ut e finibus suis exeant. Ubi iam se ad eam rem paratos esse arbitrati sunt, oppida sua omnia, numero ad duodecim, vicos ad quadringentos, reliqua privata aedificia incendunt;  frumentum omne, praeter quod secum portaturi erant, comburunt, ut domum reditionis spe sublata paratiores ad omnia pericula subeunda essent; trium mensum molita cibaria sibi quemque domo efferre iubent. Persuadent Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis finitimis, uti eodem usi consilio oppidis suis vicisque exustis una cum iis proficiscantur\".\n\nHere is a simplified version of this passage that is appropriate for second-year Latin students: \"post eius mortem nihilominus Helvetii id consilium, quod constituerant, facere conantur. id est, e finibus suis exire conantur. ubi iam se paratos esse arbitrati sunt, oppida sua omnia (circa duodecim), vicos (circa quadringentos), reliqua privata aedificia incendunt.  frumentum omne, praeter id quod secum portaturi erant, incendunt.  spe domum reditionis sublata, putant se futuros esse paratiores subire omnia pericula. iubent quemque sibi cibaria trium mensum domo effere iubent. persuadent finitimis gentibus, Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis, qui eodem consilio uti constituunt. oppidis suis vicisque incensis, una cum Helvetiis proficiscentur\".",

Vultne Iuppiter unam urbem esse pro Tyriis et pro Troianis (hominibus qui Troia profecti sunt)? Probatne Iuppiter si populi inter se miscentur? Aut probatne ille si foedera inter eos iunguntur? Haec omnia me valde incertam faciunt. Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius precibus tuis probare. Age! Ego te sequar.\u201d\n\nTum regia Iuno sic respondit:\n\nIuno loquitur:\n\u201cIste labor erit meus. Nunc tibi paucis verbis consilium meum dabo. Attende! Ego te docebo quomodo nos id, quod nunc necesse est, efficere possumus. Aeneas et miserrima Dido una parant ire in nemus ad venationem cras mane, cum Sol primum lumen afferet et orbem terrarum radiis suis monstrabit.\u201d\n\nHere are the changes I made:\n\n**Original Lines 1-3 (Venus speaking):**\n`sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam`\n`esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,`\n`miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi.`\n\n**Simplified Version (Venus speaking):**\n*\u201cSed fata me ducunt, et ego sum incerta. De Iove et consiliis eius cogito. Vultne Iuppiter unam urbem esse pro Tyriis et pro Troianis (hominibus qui Troia profecti sunt)? Probatne Iuppiter si populi inter se miscentur? Aut probatne ille si foedera inter eos iunguntur? Haec omnia me valde incertam faciunt.\"*\n\n**Summary of Changes (Lines 1-3):**\n*   The original single complex sentence expressing Venus's uncertainty has been broken into several shorter, simpler sentences.\n*   `fatis incerta feror` (I am carried uncertain by the fates) was changed to active voice and clarified: *Sed fata me ducunt, et ego sum incerta* (But the fates lead me, and I am uncertain).\n*   The core of Venus's uncertainty, expressed through subjunctive verbs in indirect questions (`si Iuppiter ... velit ... miscerive probet`), was rephrased as a series of direct questions using indicative verbs:\n    *   `si Iuppiter unam esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis` (if Jupiter should wish there to be one city for the Tyrians and those departed from Troy) became *Vultne Iuppiter unam urbem esse pro Tyriis et pro Troianis (hominibus qui Troia profecti sunt)?* (Does Jupiter want one city to exist for the Tyrians and for the Trojans (people who set out from Troy)?). The dative `Tyriis` and `Troiaque profectis` (ablative absolute participle used as dative) were clarified with `pro Tyriis et pro Troianis`, and `Troia profectis` was expanded to `hominibus qui Troia profecti sunt` for clarity.\n    *   `miscerive probet populos` (or if he approves that peoples be mixed) became *Probatne Iuppiter si populi inter se miscentur?* (Does Jupiter approve if the peoples are mixed among themselves?). The subjunctive `probet` became indicative `Probatne`, and the passive infinitive `misceri` (implied) became a passive indicative verb `miscentur` in a `si` clause.\n    *   `aut foedera iungi` (or that treaties be joined) became *Aut probatne ille si foedera inter eos iunguntur?* (Or does he approve if treaties are joined between them?). The passive infinitive `iungi` became a passive indicative verb `iunguntur` in a `si` clause.\n*   A concluding sentence *Haec omnia me valde incertam faciunt* (All these things make me very uncertain) was added to summarize Venus's state of mind, reflecting the original `incerta feror`.\n\n**Original Line 4 (Venus speaking):**\n`tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando.`\n\n**Simplified Version (Venus speaking):**\n*Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius precibus tuis probare.*\n\n**Summary of Changes (Line 4):**\n*   `tu coniunx` (you [his] spouse) was made more explicit: *Tu es uxor Iovis* (You are Jupiter's wife).\n*   `tibi fas` (it is divinely right for you) was simplified to *tibi licet* (it is permitted for you/you may).\n*   `animum temptare` (to test his spirit/mind) was rephrased with a more common verb: *animum eius ... probare* (to test his mind).\n*   The gerund `precando` (by praying) was replaced with an ablative of means using a noun: *precibus tuis* (with your prayers).\n\n**Original Line 5 (Venus speaking, then narrator):**\n`perge, sequar.\u201d tum sic excepit regia Iuno:`\n\n**Simplified Version (Venus speaking, then narrator):**\n*Age! Ego te sequar.\u201d Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:*\n\n**Summary of Changes (Line 5):**\n*   Venus's command `perge` (proceed!) was simplified to *Age!* (Come on!/Proceed!).\n*   `sequar` (I will follow) was kept, with the explicit subject *Ego te sequar* (I will follow you).\n*   The narrative `tum sic excepit regia Iuno` (then thus royal Juno replied/took up) was rephrased with a more common verb: *Tum regia Iuno sic respondit* (Then royal Juno thus responded).\n\n**Original Lines 6-7 (Juno speaking):**\n`\u201cmecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat`\n`confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo.`\n\n**Simplified Version (Juno speaking):**\n*\u201cIste labor erit meus. Nunc tibi paucis verbis consilium meum dabo. Attende! Ego te docebo quomodo nos id, quod nunc necesse est, efficere possumus.\"*\n\n**Summary of Changes (Lines 6-7):**\n*   `mecum erit iste labor` (that task will be with me/my responsibility) was simplified to *Iste labor erit meus* (That task will be mine).\n*   The complex phrasing `nunc qua ratione quod instat confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo` (now I will teach you in a few words by what means that which is at hand can be accomplished) was significantly restructured:\n    *   It was broken into introductory statements: *Nunc tibi paucis verbis consilium meum dabo. Attende!* (Now I will give you my plan in a few words. Pay attention!). `adverte` (pay attention) was kept as *Attende!*. `paucis` (in a few words) was retained.\n    *   The indirect question `qua ratione ... confieri possit` (by what means it might be able to be accomplished), which uses a subjunctive (`possit`) and a passive infinitive (`confieri`), was rephrased as an indirect question with indicative verbs: *Ego te docebo quomodo nos ... efficere possumus* (I will teach you how we can accomplish...).\n    *   `quod instat` (that which is imminent/presses on) was simplified to *id, quod nunc necesse est* (that which is now necessary).\n    *   The passive infinitive `confieri` (to be done/accomplished) was replaced with an active infinitive `efficere` (to accomplish).\n\n**Original Lines 8-10 (Juno speaking):**\n`venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido`\n`in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus`\n`extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.`\n\n**Simplified Version (Juno speaking):**\n*Aeneas et miserrima Dido una parant ire in nemus ad venationem cras mane, cum Sol primum lumen afferet et orbem terrarum radiis suis monstrabit.\u201d*\n\n**Summary of Changes (Lines 8-10):**\n*   The supine `venatum` (to hunt), expressing purpose with `ire parant`, was replaced by the prepositional phrase *ad venationem* (for hunting / to the hunt).\n*   The main clause structure `Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido in nemus ire parant` (Aeneas and most wretched Dido together prepare to go into the grove) was kept largely intact: *Aeneas et miserrima Dido una parant ire in nemus*.\n*   The temporal `ubi` clause with future perfect verbs (`ubi primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem` - when tomorrow's Titan (Sun) will have brought forth his first risings and will have uncovered the world with his rays) was simplified:\n    *   `Titan` (a poetic name for the Sun) was replaced with *Sol* (Sun).\n    *   `crastinus ortus extulerit` (will have brought forth tomorrow's rising) was simplified to *cras mane, cum Sol primum lumen afferet* (tomorrow morning, when the Sun will bring its first light). The future perfect `extulerit` was changed to a simple future `afferet`.\n    *   `radiisque retexerit orbem` (and with rays will have uncovered the world) was simplified to *et orbem terrarum radiis suis monstrabit* (and will show the world with its rays). The future perfect `retexerit` was changed to a simple future `monstrabit`, and `orbem` was clarified as *orbem terrarum* (world).\n    *   The `ubi` clause is now a `cum` clause directly linked to the timing of their going hunting."
