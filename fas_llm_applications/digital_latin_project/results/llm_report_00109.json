You are fluent in Latin, including authentic classical Latin style and tone, and you have an expert understanding of Latin grammatical structures. You use your knowledge to help Latin instructors simplify classical Latin passages so they are understandable for students who have finished two years of college Latin.\n\nYour goal is to generate a grammatically simpler version of a Latin passage provided by the instructor.\n\nAlthough you should interact with the instructor in English, you should not translate the provided Latin passage into English.\n\nHere is the process you should follow:\n\n1. Analyze the provided Latin text to identify key ideas and important details. Make sure to identify important context so you can preserve it in the simplified passage. Pay particular attention to dialog, noting who is speaking, who they are speaking to, and the subjects and objects of each statement.\n2. Rephrase the original Latin in the passage into simpler Latin, using grammar and high-frequency vocabulary appropriate for second-year Latin students. In particular, follow these rules when simplifying the passage:\n    - Do not omit any key ideas or important details.\n    - Retain all of the important context from the original passage.\n    - Do not add any new information to the passage. \n    - Do not include more than two dependent/subordinate clauses per sentence.\n    - If the original passage includes any of the following forbidden grammatical structures, replace them with simpler structures that are not forbidden:\n        - subjunctive mood verbs\n        - gerunds\n        - gerundives\n        - supines\n        - impersonal use of the passive voice\n        - double dative construction\n    - When you simplify the passage, do not add any of the forbidden grammatical structures listed above. \n3. Before providing your response, compare the original passage to the simplified version. Verify that all the key ideas and context have been retained. Pay special attention to dialog, making sure that the speaker, listener, subjects, and objects of all dialog are the same as in the original passage. If they are not, revise the simplified passage so it preserves the key ideas and context from the original passage.\n4. Before providing your response, check the simplified passage and confirm that it does not contain any of the forbidden grammatical structures listed above. If the passage still contains any of the forbidden grammatical structures, rephrase those parts of the passage so they do not use any of the forbidden structures.\n5. Present your output in the following form:\n    - Display, \"Here is the simplified passage:\"\n    - Print the simplified passage. \n    - After printing the simplified passage, describe the changes you made. Give each line or sentence in the original passage along with its simplification, and then briefly summarize the changes you made when you simplified the original line or sentence.\n\n\nWorked Example:\n\nHere is an example of an appropriate simplification. The original passage was: \"post eius mortem nihilo minus Helvetii id quod constituerant facere conantur, ut e finibus suis exeant. Ubi iam se ad eam rem paratos esse arbitrati sunt, oppida sua omnia, numero ad duodecim, vicos ad quadringentos, reliqua privata aedificia incendunt;  frumentum omne, praeter quod secum portaturi erant, comburunt, ut domum reditionis spe sublata paratiores ad omnia pericula subeunda essent; trium mensum molita cibaria sibi quemque domo efferre iubent. Persuadent Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis finitimis, uti eodem usi consilio oppidis suis vicisque exustis una cum iis proficiscantur\".\n\nHere is a simplified version of this passage that is appropriate for second-year Latin students: \"post eius mortem nihilominus Helvetii id consilium, quod constituerant, facere conantur. id est, e finibus suis exire conantur. ubi iam se paratos esse arbitrati sunt, oppida sua omnia (circa duodecim), vicos (circa quadringentos), reliqua privata aedificia incendunt.  frumentum omne, praeter id quod secum portaturi erant, incendunt.  spe domum reditionis sublata, putant se futuros esse paratiores subire omnia pericula. iubent quemque sibi cibaria trium mensum domo effere iubent. persuadent finitimis gentibus, Rauracis et Tulingis et Latobrigis, qui eodem consilio uti constituunt. oppidis suis vicisque incensis, una cum Helvetiis proficiscentur\".",

                            "text": "Here is the simplified passage:\n\nVenus dicit: \"Sed fata me incertam faciunt. De voluntate Iovis dubito. Vultne ille unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis (illis qui Troia venerunt)? Vultne ille hos populos misceri, aut foedera inter eos iungi? Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius tuis precibus temptare. Age! Ego te sequar.\"\n\nTum regia Iuno sic respondit: \"Hic labor erit meus. Nunc tibi paucis verbis (audi me!) consilium meum demonstrabo. Per hoc consilium, id quod nunc necesse est facere, nos facere poterimus. Aeneas et miserrima Dido parant ire in silvam ad venationem. Hoc fiet cras mane, cum Sol primum suum ortum ostendet et mundum radiis suis aperiet.\"\n\nHere is a description of the changes made:\n\n**Original lines 1-3:**\n`sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam`\n`esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,`\n`miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi.`\n\n**Simplified version for these lines:**\nVenus dicit: \"Sed fata me incertam faciunt. De voluntate Iovis dubito. Vultne ille unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis (illis qui Troia venerunt)? Vultne ille hos populos misceri, aut foedera inter eos iungi?\"\n\n**Summary of changes for lines 1-3:**\n*   A speaker tag \"Venus dicit:\" was added for clarity.\n*   The passive construction `fatis incerta feror` (\"I am carried uncertain by the fates\") was changed to an active construction `fata me incertam faciunt` (\"the fates make me uncertain\").\n*   The complex sentence expressing Venus's uncertainty about Jupiter's will (an indirect question with subjunctive verbs `velit` and `probet`) was broken into several simpler sentences.\n*   The indirect questions were rephrased as a statement of doubt (`De voluntate Iovis dubito`) followed by direct questions using `-ne` with indicative verbs (`Vultne ille...`). This avoids the forbidden subjunctive mood.\n*   `si Iuppiter... velit` (if Jupiter should want) was changed to `Vultne ille...` (Does he want...).\n*   `Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis` (a city for the Tyrians and for those having set out from Troy) was simplified to `Tyriis et Troianis (illis qui Troia venerunt)` (for Tyrians and Trojans (those who came from Troy)). The participle `profectis` was replaced by a relative clause with a common verb `venerunt`.\n*   `miscerive probet populos` (or if he approves that the peoples be mixed) was changed to `Vultne ille hos populos misceri` (Does he want these peoples to be mixed?). The subjunctive `probet` was replaced by the indicative `Vult` (implied from previous question) and the passive infinitive `misceri` was retained (as it's not forbidden).\n*   `aut foedera iungi` (or that treaties be joined) was kept similar as `aut foedera inter eos iungi` (or treaties to be joined between them), dependent on the implied `Vultne ille...`. The passive infinitive `iungi` is retained.\n\n**Original line 4:**\n`tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando.`\n\n**Simplified version for this line:**\n\"Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius tuis precibus temptare.\"\n\n**Summary of changes for line 4:**\n*   `tu coniunx` (you [his] spouse) was clarified to `Tu es uxor Iovis` (You are Jupiter's wife). `Uxor` is a more specific high-frequency word for \"wife.\"\n*   `tibi fas [est]` (it is right for you) was changed to `Tibi licet` (it is permitted for you/you may), which is a common expression.\n*   The gerund `precando` (by praying), an ablative of means, was replaced by the functionally equivalent and grammatically simpler ablative noun phrase `tuis precibus` (with your prayers).\n\n**Original line 5:**\n`perge, sequar.\u201d tum sic excepit regia Iuno:`\n\n**Simplified version for this line:**\n\"Age! Ego te sequar.\" Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:\n\n**Summary of changes for line 5:**\n*   `perge` (proceed!) was changed to `Age!` (Come on!/Go ahead!), a common imperative.\n*   `sequar` (I will follow) was retained as `Ego te sequar` (I will follow you), adding the explicit pronoun for clarity.\n*   `excepit` (replied/took up) was changed to `respondit` (replied), a more common verb.\n*   A speaker tag \"Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:\" was used to introduce Juno's speech.\n\n**Original lines 6-7:**\n`\u201cmecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat`\n`confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo.`\n\n**Simplified version for these lines:**\n\"Hic labor erit meus. Nunc tibi paucis verbis (audi me!) consilium meum demonstrabo. Per hoc consilium, id quod nunc necesse est facere, nos facere poterimus.\"\n\n**Summary of changes for lines 6-7:**\n*   `mecum erit iste labor` (that task will be with me/my responsibility) was simplified to `Hic labor erit meus` (This task will be mine).\n*   The indirect question `qua ratione quod instat confieri possit, ... docebo` (I will teach by what means that which is at hand can be accomplished), which uses the forbidden subjunctive `possit`, was rephrased.\n*   It became a direct statement: `Nunc tibi paucis verbis (audi me!) consilium meum demonstrabo` (Now I will show you my plan in a few words (listen to me!)).\n*   The means of accomplishment is then stated in a subsequent sentence: `Per hoc consilium, id quod nunc necesse est facere, nos facere poterimus` (Through this plan, we will be able to do that which is now necessary to do).\n*   `quod instat` (that which is pressing/at hand) was rephrased as `id quod nunc necesse est facere` (that which it is now necessary to do). The impersonal expression `necesse est` + infinitive is common and not a forbidden structure.\n*   `confieri` (to be accomplished - passive infinitive) was effectively replaced by `facere poterimus` (we will be able to do).\n*   `paucis (adverte) docebo` (I will teach in a few words (pay attention)) was changed to `paucis verbis (audi me!) ... demonstrabo` (I will show in a few words (listen to me!)). `audi me` is a simple imperative phrase.\n\n**Original lines 8-10:**\n`venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido`\n`in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus`\n`extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.`\n\n**Simplified version for these lines:**\n\"Aeneas et miserrima Dido parant ire in silvam ad venationem. Hoc fiet cras mane, cum Sol primum suum ortum ostendet et mundum radiis suis aperiet.\"\n\n**Summary of changes for lines 8-10:**\n*   The supine `venatum` (to hunt), expressing purpose with a verb of motion, is a forbidden structure. It was replaced by the prepositional phrase `ad venationem` (to the hunt / for hunting).\n*   `in nemus` (into the grove) was changed to `in silvam` (into the forest/woods), using a more common noun.\n*   The temporal clause `ubi primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem` (when tomorrow Titan (the Sun) will have brought forth his first risings and with his rays will have uncovered the world) used future perfect indicatives (`extulerit`, `retexerit`).\n*   This was simplified to a new sentence `Hoc fiet cras mane` (This will happen tomorrow morning) followed by a temporal clause with `cum` and simple future indicative verbs: `cum Sol primum suum ortum ostendet et mundum radiis suis aperiet` (when the Sun will show its first rising and will open up the world with its rays).\n*   `Titan` (a poetic name for the Sun) was changed to `Sol` (Sun), a more common word.\n*   `primos ... ortus` (first risings) was simplified to `primum suum ortum` (its first rising).\n*   `extulerit` (will have brought forth) was changed to `ostendet` (will show - future indicative).\n*   `retexerit orbem` (will have uncovered the world) was changed to `mundum ... aperiet` (will open up the world - future indicative). `orbem` was changed to `mundum`, both meaning \"world\" but `mundus` is common."
