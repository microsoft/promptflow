Here is the simplified passage:

Venus dicit: "Sed fata me incertam faciunt. De voluntate Iovis dubito. Vultne ille unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis (illis qui Troia venerunt)? Vultne ille hos populos misceri, aut foedera inter eos iungi? Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius tuis precibus temptare. Age! Ego te sequar."

Tum regia Iuno sic respondit: "Hic labor erit meus. Nunc tibi paucis verbis (audi me!) consilium meum demonstrabo. Per hoc consilium, id quod nunc necesse est facere, nos facere poterimus. Aeneas et miserrima Dido parant ire in silvam ad venationem. Hoc fiet cras mane, cum Sol primum suum ortum ostendet et mundum radiis suis aperiet."

Here is a description of the changes made:

**Original lines 1-3:**
`sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam`
`esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,`
`miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi.`

**Simplified version for these lines:**
Venus dicit: "Sed fata me incertam faciunt. De voluntate Iovis dubito. Vultne ille unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis (illis qui Troia venerunt)? Vultne ille hos populos misceri, aut foedera inter eos iungi?"

**Summary of changes for lines 1-3:**
*   A speaker tag "Venus dicit:" was added for clarity.
*   The passive construction `fatis incerta feror` ("I am carried uncertain by the fates") was changed to an active construction `fata me incertam faciunt` ("the fates make me uncertain").
*   The complex sentence expressing Venus's uncertainty about Jupiter's will (an indirect question with subjunctive verbs `velit` and `probet`) was broken into several simpler sentences.
*   The indirect questions were rephrased as a statement of doubt (`De voluntate Iovis dubito`) followed by direct questions using `-ne` with indicative verbs (`Vultne ille...`). This avoids the forbidden subjunctive mood.
*   `si Iuppiter... velit` (if Jupiter should want) was changed to `Vultne ille...` (Does he want...).
*   `Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis` (a city for the Tyrians and for those having set out from Troy) was simplified to `Tyriis et Troianis (illis qui Troia venerunt)` (for Tyrians and Trojans (those who came from Troy)). The participle `profectis` was replaced by a relative clause with a common verb `venerunt`.
*   `miscerive probet populos` (or if he approves that the peoples be mixed) was changed to `Vultne ille hos populos misceri` (Does he want these peoples to be mixed?). The subjunctive `probet` was replaced by the indicative `Vult` (implied from previous question) and the passive infinitive `misceri` was retained (as it's not forbidden).
*   `aut foedera iungi` (or that treaties be joined) was kept similar as `aut foedera inter eos iungi` (or treaties to be joined between them), dependent on the implied `Vultne ille...`. The passive infinitive `iungi` is retained.

**Original line 4:**
`tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando.`

**Simplified version for this line:**
"Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius tuis precibus temptare."

**Summary of changes for line 4:**
*   `tu coniunx` (you [his] spouse) was clarified to `Tu es uxor Iovis` (You are Jupiter's wife). `Uxor` is a more specific high-frequency word for "wife."
*   `tibi fas [est]` (it is right for you) was changed to `Tibi licet` (it is permitted for you/you may), which is a common expression.
*   The gerund `precando` (by praying), an ablative of means, was replaced by the functionally equivalent and grammatically simpler ablative noun phrase `tuis precibus` (with your prayers).

**Original line 5:**
`perge, sequar.” tum sic excepit regia Iuno:`

**Simplified version for this line:**
"Age! Ego te sequar." Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:

**Summary of changes for line 5:**
*   `perge` (proceed!) was changed to `Age!` (Come on!/Go ahead!), a common imperative.
*   `sequar` (I will follow) was retained as `Ego te sequar` (I will follow you), adding the explicit pronoun for clarity.
*   `excepit` (replied/took up) was changed to `respondit` (replied), a more common verb.
*   A speaker tag "Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:" was used to introduce Juno's speech.

**Original lines 6-7:**
`“mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat`
`confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo.`

**Simplified version for these lines:**
"Hic labor erit meus. Nunc tibi paucis verbis (audi me!) consilium meum demonstrabo. Per hoc consilium, id quod nunc necesse est facere, nos facere poterimus."

**Summary of changes for lines 6-7:**
*   `mecum erit iste labor` (that task will be with me/my responsibility) was simplified to `Hic labor erit meus` (This task will be mine).
*   The indirect question `qua ratione quod instat confieri possit, ... docebo` (I will teach by what means that which is at hand can be accomplished), which uses the forbidden subjunctive `possit`, was rephrased.
*   It became a direct statement: `Nunc tibi paucis verbis (audi me!) consilium meum demonstrabo` (Now I will show you my plan in a few words (listen to me!)).
*   The means of accomplishment is then stated in a subsequent sentence: `Per hoc consilium, id quod nunc necesse est facere, nos facere poterimus` (Through this plan, we will be able to do that which is now necessary to do).
*   `quod instat` (that which is pressing/at hand) was rephrased as `id quod nunc necesse est facere` (that which it is now necessary to do). The impersonal expression `necesse est` + infinitive is common and not a forbidden structure.
*   `confieri` (to be accomplished - passive infinitive) was effectively replaced by `facere poterimus` (we will be able to do).
*   `paucis (adverte) docebo` (I will teach in a few words (pay attention)) was changed to `paucis verbis (audi me!) ... demonstrabo` (I will show in a few words (listen to me!)). `audi me` is a simple imperative phrase.

**Original lines 8-10:**
`venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido`
`in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus`
`extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.`

**Simplified version for these lines:**
"Aeneas et miserrima Dido parant ire in silvam ad venationem. Hoc fiet cras mane, cum Sol primum suum ortum ostendet et mundum radiis suis aperiet."

**Summary of changes for lines 8-10:**
*   The supine `venatum` (to hunt), expressing purpose with a verb of motion, is a forbidden structure. It was replaced by the prepositional phrase `ad venationem` (to the hunt / for hunting).
*   `in nemus` (into the grove) was changed to `in silvam` (into the forest/woods), using a more common noun.
*   The temporal clause `ubi primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem` (when tomorrow Titan (the Sun) will have brought forth his first risings and with his rays will have uncovered the world) used future perfect indicatives (`extulerit`, `retexerit`).
*   This was simplified to a new sentence `Hoc fiet cras mane` (This will happen tomorrow morning) followed by a temporal clause with `cum` and simple future indicative verbs: `cum Sol primum suum ortum ostendet et mundum radiis suis aperiet` (when the Sun will show its first rising and will open up the world with its rays).
*   `Titan` (a poetic name for the Sun) was changed to `Sol` (Sun), a more common word.
*   `primos ... ortus` (first risings) was simplified to `primum suum ortum` (its first rising).
*   `extulerit` (will have brought forth) was changed to `ostendet` (will show - future indicative).
*   `retexerit orbem` (will have uncovered the world) was changed to `mundum ... aperiet` (will open up the world - future indicative). `orbem` was changed to `mundum`, both meaning "world" but `mundus` is common.
