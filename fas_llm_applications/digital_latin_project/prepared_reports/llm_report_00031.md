Here is the simplified passage:  
"sed de fatis non certa sum. si Iuppiter unam urbem Tyriis et Troianis dare vult, aut populos miscere et foedera facere probat, tu, coniunx, per preces animum meum temptare potes. perge, ego te sequar.” tum regina Iuno respondit: “mecum hoc laboris erit. nunc dicam brevi quomodo res fiat. attende. Aeneas et Dido misera in silvam ad venationem parant ire. ibi, cum sol cras orietur et mundum luce sua operiet, illi venabuntur."

Reasoning Content:

Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to simplify a Latin passage for first-year students. The original text is from the Aeneid, specifically the conversation between Juno and Venus. I need to make sure I follow all the rules given.

First, I need to analyze the original lines. Let's break it down line by line.

"sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam / esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis," – Venus is uncertain about the fates, wondering if Jupiter wants a single city for the Tyrians and Trojans. The subjunctives here (velit, probet) need to be changed to indicative. Also, "fatis incerta feror" is a passive periphrastic? Or maybe "feror" is being used passively. Maybe rephrase to "non certa sum" to avoid the passive.

"miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi." – Mixing peoples or approving treaties. "probet" is subjunctive, so change to indicative "probat". "iungi" is a passive infinitive, but the rule says no impersonal passives. Maybe "foedera fieri" instead?

"tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando." – Addressing Juno as spouse, saying it's right for her to test Venus's mind with prayer. "fas" is okay, but "temptare" is present infinitive. Maybe keep it as is, but check if "precando" is a gerund. Gerunds are not allowed. So "per preces" instead of "precando".

"perge, sequar.” tum sic excepit regia Iuno:" – "Go on, I'll follow." Then Juno responds. "excepit" is perfect tense, which is okay. "regia Iuno" – maybe "regina Iuno" for clarity.

"mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo." – Juno says the labor will be with her, and she'll explain how to do what's needed. "possit" is subjunctive, needs to change to indicative "potest". "adverte" is imperative, allowed. "paucis" as ablative of means, okay.

"venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem." – They prepare to go hunting where Titan (sun) will rise. "extulerit" and "retexerit" are future perfects. Since future perfect is allowed, maybe keep, but students might find it tricky. Alternatively, change to future tense "efferet" and "retexet". Also "venatum" is a supine, which is forbidden. Replace with "ad venandum" or "ut venentur". But "ad venandum" uses a gerund, which is also forbidden. Hmm. Maybe rephrase the purpose clause with "ut" and a subjunctive, but subjunctives are not allowed. So perhaps "parant ire in nemus ad venandum" but that uses a gerund. Alternatively, "parant ire in nemus et venari", but "venari" is a deponent infinitive, which is also forbidden. This is tricky. Maybe use "capture animals" with a different verb like "animalia capere". So "Aeneas et Dido in nemus eunt ut animalia capiant." But subjunctive again. Wait, the rules say no subjunctive verbs. So maybe rephrase as a purpose with "ad" and accusative noun. "Aeneas et Dido in nemus ad venationem eunt." That uses a noun instead, avoiding the supine and gerund.

Putting it all together step by step, making sure each sentence has no more than one subordinate clause, and replacing forbidden structures with simpler ones. Also checking vocabulary to use high-frequency words. For example, "miserrima" could be "misera" to simplify. "Titan" might be "sol" for clarity. "retexerit orbem" could be "mundum illuminabit" or something. Let me try to draft each line with these changes.
