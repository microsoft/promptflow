Here is the simplified passage:  
sed incerta sum, quia Fata non cognosco. si Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et his qui Troia profecti sunt, aut si probat quod populi miscentur aut foedera fiunt, tu, coniunx, per preces animum temptare potes. perge; ego sequar.” tum regia Iuno respondit: “mecum hoc erit. nunc dicam brevi quomodo res fiat (audi). Aeneas et Dido infelix in silvam venatum ire parant. hoc facient cum cras Titan lucem et orbem radiis ostendet.

Reasoning Content:

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to simplify a Latin passage for first-year students. First, I need to analyze the original text. The lines are from the Aeneid, where Juno and Venus are scheming. Key points: Aeneas and Dido are going hunting, Juno plans to cause a storm to get them together, and there's some divine intervention.

Looking at the grammar, there are subjunctives like "velit" and "probet," and participles like "profectis." Also, "miscerive" and "iungi" are infinitives in indirect statements. The forbidden structures here include subjunctives, participles, and possibly the impersonal passive.

I need to rephrase without those. Replace subjunctives with indicative verbs. For example, "si Iuppiter unam esse velit" becomes "si Iuppiter unam urbem esse vult." Change participles to relative clauses: "Troiaque profectis" becomes "qui Troia profecti sunt." Indirect statements can be turned into direct speech or rephrased with quod clauses. 

Check each line. "miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi" becomes "populos misceri probet aut foedera iungi." But "iungi" is a passive infinitive, which might be allowed if it's not part of an indirect statement. Wait, the original uses "probare" with accusative and infinitive, which is an indirect statement. So replace that with a quod clause: "quod populos misceri aut foedera iungi probat."

"tibi fas animum temptare precando" has a gerund "precando," which is forbidden. Change to "per preces" or "cum precaris."

"perge, sequar" is okay, imperative and future. "tum sic excepit regia Iuno" – "excepit" is past tense, maybe "respondit" for simplicity.

"mecum erit iste labor" is fine. "adverte" is imperative, keep it. "venatum...ire parant" – "venatum" is a supine, so replace with "ad venandum" or "ut venentur." But supines are forbidden, so "parant ut in nemus eant et venentur."

"primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan" – subjunctive "extulerit" becomes future perfect, but in a temporal clause, maybe "cum Titan ortus extulerit." Wait, "ubi...extulerit" is a when clause with future perfect, which is okay for time clauses. Maybe keep as is if students know future perfect, otherwise "cum Titan ortus extulit."

"radiisque retexerit orbem" – same issue, change to "retexuit."

Check for any remaining forbidden structures. Replace deponents if any. "profecti sunt" is active, so that's okay. "precando" changed to "preces." No participles, subjunctives, gerunds, etc. Now, ensure the meaning stays the same. Key points: Juno's plan, the hunting trip, the storm. Make sure speakers are clear. Dido and Aeneas going to the woods, Titan rising. 

Putting it all together, simplify each part step by step, keeping sentences short and using high-frequency vocab. Make sure each sentence has one main clause, maybe a relative clause, but no complex subordination. Check again for forbidden structures. Align the simplified version with the original's context and dialogue.
