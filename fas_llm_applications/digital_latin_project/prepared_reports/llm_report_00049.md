Here is the simplified passage:

sed fatis incerta feror. si Iuppiter unam  
urbem Tyriis et Troianis profectis esse vult,  
misceri populos probat aut foedera iungi.  
tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precibus.  
perge, sequar.” tum sic excepit regia Iuno:  
“mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione id quod instat  
confieri potest, paucis (adverte) docebo.  
venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido  
in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus  
extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.

Reasoning Content:

Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to simplify a Latin passage for second-year students, avoiding certain complex structures. The original text is from the Aeneid, specifically the interaction between Juno and Venus.

First, I need to analyze the original lines. Let's break it down line by line.

"sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam / esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis," – Here, Venus is speaking. She's uncertain about the fates and whether Jupiter wants a single city for the Tyrians and Trojans. The subjunctive "velit" and "profectis" (which is a perfect participle, not a subjunctive, but "profectis" is a deponent verb's participle) need attention. The subjunctive "velit" is in a conditional clause, which is a forbidden structure. I need to replace the subjunctive with an indicative or another structure.

"miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi." – More subjunctives here: "probet" and "iungi" (passive infinitive, but "iungi" is a passive form, which might be okay unless it's impersonal. "foedera iungi" is a passive infinitive as the object of "probet." Since "probet" is subjunctive, that's the main issue. Need to rephrase without subjunctive.

"tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando. / perge, sequar.” – Venus addressing Juno. "fas" is impersonal, but "temptare" is infinitive in an indirect statement? Or is it an imperative? "Perge, sequar" – "sequar" is future indicative, which is okay.

"tum sic excepit regia Iuno: / 'mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo." – Juno responds. "possit" is subjunctive in indirect question, which is forbidden. Need to change to indicative or rephrase. "adverte" is imperative, which is allowed.

"venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem." – "extulerit" and "retexerit" are future perfect indicatives, which are okay. The structure "ubi...extulerit" is a temporal clause with future perfect, which is acceptable for time clauses in Latin. So those verbs are fine.

Now, the forbidden structures here are the subjunctives: velit, probet, possit. Also, check for gerunds, gerundives, etc. "precando" is a gerundive? Wait, "precando" is the ablative singular of the gerund of "precor." So that's a gerund, which is forbidden. Need to replace that.

So step by step:

1. "si Iuppiter unam esse velit..." – Change "velit" to indicative. Maybe "vult" but that changes meaning from "would want" to "wants." Alternatively, rephrase the conditional. Maybe "si Iuppiter unam urbem esse vult..." 

2. "miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi." – "probet" is subjunctive. Change to indicative "probat" but that might not fit. The context is "whether Jupiter approves of mixing peoples or forming alliances." So maybe "misceri populos probat aut foedera iungi." But "iungi" is passive infinitive. Is that allowed? The rule says impersonal passive is forbidden, but "foedera iungi" is a personal passive. So maybe it's okay. But "probat" would be indicative.

3. "temptare precando" – "precando" is gerund. Replace with a noun or prepositional phrase. Maybe "per preces" (through prayers) or "precibus" (with prayers).

4. "qua ratione quod instat confieri possit" – "possit" is subjunctive. Change to "potest" but that would make it a direct question. Alternatively, rephrase the indirect question to a direct statement. Maybe "qua ratione id quod instat confieri potest" – "how what is pressing can be done."

Now, applying these changes:

Original: "sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam / esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,"

Simplified: "sed fatis incerta feror. si Iuppiter unam urbem Tyriis et Troianis (qui profecti sunt) esse vult,"

Changed "velit" to "vult" and expanded "Troiaque profectis" to "Troianis qui profecti sunt" for clarity, using a relative clause instead of the participle. But "profectis" is a perfect participle, which is allowed? The forbidden structures include gerunds, gerundives, supines, etc., but participles are okay unless they're part of a periphrastic. So maybe "Troiaque profectis" can stay as "Troianis profectis" (dative plural), but that might be confusing. Alternatively, "Troianis qui profecti sunt" makes it clearer with a relative clause.

Next line: "miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi."

Simplified: "misceri populos probat aut foedera iungi." – Changed "probet" to "probat."

"tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando."

"precando" is a gerund. Change to "precibus" (ablative of means): "temptare precibus."

So: "tu coniunx, tibi fas est animum temptare precibus."

"perge, sequar.” 

"tum sic excepit regia Iuno: / 'mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo."

Change "possit" to "potest": "qua ratione id quod instat confieri potest, paucis (adverte) docebo."

"venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem."

The future perfects "extulerit" and "retexerit" are okay, as they are in temporal clauses with future meaning. So no change needed there.

Putting it all together, making sure the meaning is preserved, no subjunctives, gerunds, etc. Also, check for other forbidden structures. Let me verify each line again.

Final simplified passage should look something like:

sed fatis incerta feror. si Iuppiter unam urbem Tyriis et Troianis (qui profecti sunt) esse vult, 
misceri populos probat aut foedera iungi. 
tu coniunx, tibi fas est animum temptare precibus. 
perge, sequar.” 
tum sic excepit regia Iuno: 
“mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione id quod instat confieri potest, paucis (adverte) docebo. 
venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido 
in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus 
extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.

Wait, "Troianis qui profecti sunt" – the original is "Troiaque profectis" (dative plural). So "to the Trojans who have departed." Maybe "Troianis profectis" is acceptable as a participle, which is allowed. Participles are not forbidden unless part of a periphrastic. So perhaps better to keep "Troiaque profectis" as "Troianis profectis" (dative). But "Troiaque" is "Troy and...", but in the original, it's "Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis" – so "a city for the Tyrians and for those who set out from Troy." So "Tyriis et Troianis profectis" might be clearer. But the original is "Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis" – "a city for the Tyrians and for those who set out from Troy." So in the simplified version, maybe "urbem Tyriis et Troianis (qui e Troia profecti sunt)" to clarify.

Alternatively, "Tyriis et Troianis profectis" – but "profectis" is still a participle. Since participles are allowed, maybe it's okay. The forbidden structures are gerunds, gerundives, supines, etc., not participles. So "profectis" is a perfect participle, which is allowed. So perhaps the original line can be kept as is, except changing "velit" to "vult" and "probet" to "probat."

So revised simplified passage:

sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam
esse vult Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,
misceri populos probat aut foedera iungi.
tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precibus.
perge, sequar.” tum sic excepit regia Iuno:
“mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat
confieri potest, paucis (adverte) docebo.
venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido
in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus
extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.

This way, the subjunctives "velit" and "probet" are changed to "vult" and "probat," and "precando" becomes "precibus." The rest of the structures are permissible. The future perfect verbs in the last lines are acceptable. Check for any other issues. The conditional "si Iuppiter... vult" is now indicative, which is simpler. The gerund "precando" is replaced with "precibus." The indirect question "qua ratione... possit" becomes "qua ratione... potest," turning it into a direct statement. This should comply with the rules.
