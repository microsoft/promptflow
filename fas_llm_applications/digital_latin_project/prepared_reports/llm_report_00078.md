Here is the simplified passage:

Sed ego sum incerta de fatis. Fortasse Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis qui ex Troia venerunt. Aut fortasse Iuppiter vult hos populos miscere. Aut fortasse Iuppiter vult eos foedera iungere.
Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius cum precibus temptare.
“Perge! Ego tecum faciam.”
Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:
“Hic labor erit meus. Nunc ego te paucis verbis docebo. (Tu animum adverte!) Ego tibi monstrabo modum. Per hunc modum, nos possumus efficere rem quae nunc instat.
Aeneas et miserrima Dido cum eo parant ire in nemus. Ibi illi venabuntur. Hoc fiet cras. Cras mane Titan (Sol) primum lumen suum efferet et orbem terrarum radiis suis aperiet.”

Here is a description of the changes made:

**Original Lines 1-3:**
"sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam
esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,
miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi."

**Simplified Version:**
"Sed ego sum incerta de fatis. Fortasse Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis qui ex Troia venerunt. Aut fortasse Iuppiter vult hos populos miscere. Aut fortasse Iuppiter vult eos foedera iungere."

**Summary of Changes:**
*   The passive construction `fatis incerta feror` ("I am carried uncertain by the fates") was changed to an active statement `Sed ego sum incerta de fatis` ("But I am uncertain about the fates").
*   The indirect questions introduced by `si` (`si Iuppiter ... velit ... miscerive probet`) containing subjunctive verbs (`velit`, `probet`) were rephrased as declarative statements using `Fortasse` ("perhaps") and indicative verbs (`vult`). This maintains the sense of uncertainty.
*   The accusative and infinitive construction `unam esse ... urbem` (an indirect statement dependent on `velit`) was simplified to `unam urbem esse` functioning as a complementary infinitive phrase with the main verb `vult`.
*   The dative participle phrase `Troiaque profectis` ("and for those having set out from Troy") was clarified and simplified into a relative clause: `Troianis qui ex Troia venerunt` ("for the Trojans who came from Troy").
*   The passive infinitives `misceri` ("to be mixed") and `iungi` ("to be joined"), dependent on `probet`, were changed to active infinitives `miscere` ("to mix") and `iungere` ("to join"), dependent on `vult`. The enclitic `-ve` ("or") was replaced by `aut` ("or").

**Original Line 4:**
"tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando."

**Simplified Version:**
"Tu es uxor Iovis. Tibi licet animum eius cum precibus temptare."

**Summary of Changes:**
*   The appositive `tu coniunx` ("you, spouse") was made more explicit for a first-year student as `Tu es uxor Iovis` ("You are Jupiter's wife").
*   The phrase `tibi fas [est]` ("it is right for you") was simplified to `Tibi licet` ("it is permitted for you" or "you may").
*   The ablative gerund `precando` ("by praying"), indicating means, was replaced by the prepositional phrase `cum precibus` ("with prayers"), which also expresses means and is simpler.

**Original Line 5:**
"perge, sequar.” tum sic excepit regia Iuno:"

**Simplified Version:**
"“Perge! Ego tecum faciam.” Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:"

**Summary of Changes:**
*   The imperative `perge` ("proceed!") was retained.
*   The deponent future indicative verb `sequar` ("I shall follow") was replaced by the active future indicative phrase `Ego tecum faciam` ("I will act with you" or "I will join you"), avoiding the deponent verb.
*   The perfect indicative verb `excepit` ("replied" or "took up") was replaced by the simpler and more common synonym `respondit` ("replied").

**Original Lines 6-7:**
“mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat
confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo."

**Simplified Version:**
"“Hic labor erit meus. Nunc ego te paucis verbis docebo. (Tu animum adverte!) Ego tibi monstrabo modum. Per hunc modum, nos possumus efficere rem quae nunc instat."

**Summary of Changes:**
*   The phrase `mecum erit iste labor` ("that task will be with me/my responsibility") was rephrased for clarity as `Hic labor erit meus` ("This task will be mine").
*   The complex indirect question `qua ratione quod instat confieri possit` ("by what means that which is pressing can be accomplished"), which includes a subjunctive verb (`possit`) and a passive infinitive (`confieri`), was broken down and rephrased into direct statements with indicative verbs.
    *   The core idea of explaining the method `nunc ... docebo` was kept: `Nunc ego te paucis verbis docebo.` The parenthetical imperative `adverte` ("pay attention!") was kept as `(Tu animum adverte!)`.
    *   The indirect question itself was changed into: `Ego tibi monstrabo modum. Per hunc modum, nos possumus efficere rem quae nunc instat.` ("I will show you the way. By this way, we are able to accomplish the thing which is now pressing.")
    *   `quod instat` ("that which is pressing," a substantive use of the relative pronoun) was changed to `rem quae nunc instat` ("the thing which is now pressing"), providing an explicit antecedent `rem` for the relative pronoun `quae`.
    *   The passive infinitive `confieri` ("to be accomplished") with the subjunctive `possit` was replaced by the active infinitive `efficere` ("to accomplish") with the indicative verb `possumus` ("we are able").

**Original Lines 8-10:**
"venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido
in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus
extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem."

**Simplified Version:**
"Aeneas et miserrima Dido cum eo parant ire in nemus. Ibi illi venabuntur. Hoc fiet cras. Cras mane Titan (Sol) primum lumen suum efferet et orbem terrarum radiis suis aperiet.”

**Summary of Changes:**
*   The supine `venatum` ("to hunt," expressing purpose) was replaced by a separate sentence with an active future indicative verb: `Ibi illi venabuntur` ("There they will hunt").
*   `unaque miserrima Dido` ("and with him most wretched Dido") was slightly expanded for clarity to `et miserrima Dido cum eo` ("and most wretched Dido with him").
*   The temporal clause `ubi primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem` ("when tomorrow's Titan (sun) will have brought forth its first risings and uncovered the world with its rays"), which uses future perfect indicative verbs (`extulerit`, `retexerit`), was simplified. It was broken into two simpler declarative sentences using future indicative verbs to describe the future event: `Hoc fiet cras.` ("This will happen tomorrow.") and `Cras mane Titan (Sol) primum lumen suum efferet et orbem terrarum radiis suis aperiet.` ("Tomorrow morning Titan (the Sun) will bring forth its first light and will uncover the world with its rays.")
    *   `Titan` was clarified with the apposition `(Sol)`.
    *   `primos crastinus ortus extulerit` was simplified to `primum lumen suum efferet`.
    *   `radiisque retexerit orbem` was simplified to `et orbem terrarum radiis suis aperiet`.
