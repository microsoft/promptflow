Here is the simplified passage:  
sed de fatis incerta sum. si Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis qui Troia profecti sunt, aut probat misceri populos aut foedera facere. tu, coniunx, licet animum meum precibus temptes. perge, post te ibo.” tum regia Iuno respondit: “mecum erit hic labor. nunc docebo paucis qua ratione id quod instat fieri potest. attende. Aeneas et Dido infelix parant ire in nemus ad venationem. ubi cras sol ortum primum ostendet et orbem radiis illuminabit.”

Reasoning Content:

Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to simplify a Latin passage for first-year students. The original text is from the Aeneid, specifically the conversation between Juno and Venus. I need to make sure I follow all the rules they outlined.

First, I need to analyze the original passage. The key ideas here are the uncertainty of fate, Jupiter's potential will regarding the Tyrians and Trojans, the mixing of peoples, and the plan to have Dido and Aeneas meet in the forest. The dialogue is between Juno and Venus, so I need to preserve who is speaking to whom and their intentions.

Looking at the grammatical structures, there are several subjunctives like "feror," "velit," "probet," "iungi," "temptare," "sequar," "possit," "adverte," "parant," "extulerit," and "retexerit." These need to be replaced with indicative verbs. Also, there's a participle "profectis" which I need to handle. The gerundive "iungi" in "foedera iungi" is a passive periphrastic, so I need to rephrase that without the gerundive. The deponent verb "proficiscantur" isn't here, but I should check for others. There's an indirect statement with "probet populos aut foedera iungi," which I need to convert into a direct statement or a simpler structure.

Starting line by line:

"sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam / esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis," – "feror" is present passive, but "incerta feror" is a passive construction. Maybe change to "incerta sum" to avoid the passive. "si Iuppiter unam esse velit urbem..." – the subjunctive "velit" here is in a conditional clause. Since subjunctives are forbidden, I need to use the indicative. So "si Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse..." Also, "Troiaque profectis" is an ablative absolute with a participle. Replace "profectis" with a clause like "qui Troia profecti sunt."

"miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi." – "probet" is subjunctive, so change to indicative "probat." "iungi" is passive infinitive, which is allowed? Wait, the forbidden structures include gerundives and supines, but passive infinitives might be okay. However, "foedera iungi" is a gerundive (foedera iungenda?), but here it's "iungi" passive infinitive. Hmm, maybe rephrase as "foedera firmari" or "foedera facere."

"tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando. / perge, sequar.” – "temptare" is infinitive in indirect statement? "fas est" with infinitive is okay. "sequar" is future indicative, but "sequar" is also deponent. Wait, "sequar" is future active, but deponent verbs are forbidden. So need to replace "sequar" with a non-deponent verb. Maybe "te sequam" but that's subjunctive. Wait, "sequar" is 1st person singular future of sequi, which is deponent. So need to replace with a non-deponent verb. Maybe "post te ibo" or "te sequi volo."

"tum sic excepit regia Iuno: / “mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo." – "excepit" is perfect indicative. "possit" is subjunctive, need to change to "potest." "adverte" is imperative, which is okay. "docebo" is future, fine.

"venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem." – "venatum" is supine, which is forbidden. Replace with "ad venandum" but that's a gerund. Alternatively, "ire venatum" becomes "ire ut venentur" but that's a purpose clause with subjunctive. Wait, but purpose clauses use subjunctive, which is forbidden. So maybe rephrase as "parant ire in nemus ad venandum." "extulerit" and "retexerit" are future perfects. Since future perfect is allowed (indicative), but maybe simplify to future tense: "extollet" and "retexet."

Putting it all together step by step, replacing subjunctives with indicatives, deponent verbs with active ones, avoiding participles, gerunds, etc. Let me check each line again.

Original: "sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,"

Simplified: "sed de fatis incerta sum. si Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis qui Troia profecti sunt,"

Changed "feror" to "sum," "velit" to "vult," "Troiaque profectis" to "Troianis qui Troia profecti sunt" (using relative clause instead of participle).

Next line: "miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi."

Simplified: "et probat misceri populos aut foedera firmari."

"probet" to "probat," "iungi" to "firmari" (passive infinitive, but maybe "facere foedera" instead? "aut foedera facere." But "iungi" is "to be joined," so "firmari" as "to be established."

"tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando. / perge, sequar.”

Simplified: "tu, coniunx, potes animum meum precibus temptare. perge, post te ibo."

Changed "fas est" to "potes" (since "fas" is tricky, "you can"), "temptare" remains infinitive but with "potes." "sequar" becomes "post te ibo."

"tum sic excepit regia Iuno: / “mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo."

Simplified: "tum regia Iuno respondit: 'mecum erit hic labor. nunc docebo paucis qua ratione id quod instat confieri potest. attende.'"

"excepit" to "respondit," "possit" to "potest," moved "adverte" to "attende" as imperative.

"venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem."

Simplified: "Aeneas et Dido infelix parant ire in nemus ad venandum. ubi cras Titan ortum primum extollet et orbem radiis retexet."

Changed "venatum" to "ad venandum" (gerund is forbidden, so maybe "ad venandum" is a gerundive? Wait, "ad" + accusative gerund is allowed? Wait, the forbidden structures include gerunds and gerundives. So "ad venandum" is a gerund, which is forbidden. So need another way. Maybe "ut venentur" but that's a purpose clause with subjunctive. Since subjunctives are forbidden, perhaps "parant venari in nemus" but "venari" is deponent infinitive. Hmm. Alternatively, "parant ire in nemus et venari," but "venari" is deponent. So maybe "parant ire in nemus et feras capere" or "parant ire in nemus ad feras capiendas." But "capiendas" is a gerundive. This is tricky. Maybe rephrase the purpose: "parant ire in nemus ubi feras capiunt." But that changes the meaning. Alternatively, use a different verb. Maybe "parant ire in nemus ad venationem." Using a noun instead. "venationem" is a noun, so that's acceptable. So "ad venationem" – "for a hunt."

So the line becomes: "Aeneas et Dido infelix parant ire in nemus ad venationem. ubi cras Titan ortum primum extollet et orbem radiis retexet."

That avoids the supine and gerund.

Also, "extulerit" and "retexerit" are future perfects. Changed to future "extollet" and "retexet."

Now check all forbidden structures:

- No subjunctives: replaced with indicatives.
- No deponent verbs: replaced "sequar" with "ibo," checked others.
- No participles: replaced ablative absolute with relative clause.
- No gerunds/gerundives: replaced "venatum" with "ad venationem."
- No indirect statements: the original had some, but rephrased.
- No other forbidden structures.

Key ideas preserved: Juno and Venus's plan, the hunt, the next day's sunrise. Speakers remain the same. All key points retained.
