Here is the simplified passage:

Venus loquitur:
"Sed ego sum incerta propter fata. Ego nescio. Vultne Iuppiter unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis? Troiani ex Troia venerunt. Aut probatne Iuppiter populos miscere? Aut probatne foedera iungere? Tu es uxor Iovis. Te decet animum eius temptare. Tu eum precibus tuis movere potes. Age! Ego te iuvabo."

Tum regina Iuno sic respondit:
"Ego istud opus faciam. Nunc tibi consilium meum paucis verbis monstrabo. (Tu animum adverte!) Hoc consilium est de re necessaria. Docebo te quomodo hoc facere possumus. Aeneas et miserrima Dido simul parant. Volunt ire in silvam. Ibi animalia capient. Hoc facient ubi cras Sol primum lumen tollet et radiis suis mundum ostendet."

Here is a description of the changes made:

**Original line 1 (Venus speaking):** "sed fatis incerta feror,"
**Simplified version:** "Sed ego sum incerta propter fata."
**Changes:**
*   The deponent verb `feror` ("I am carried/led") was replaced with the active verb `sum` ("I am").
*   The idea of being "carried by fate" was simplified to being "uncertain because of the fates" (`propter fata`), making the cause of uncertainty explicit.

**Original lines 1-3 (Venus speaking):** "si Iuppiter unam / esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis, / miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi."
**Simplified version:** "Ego nescio. Vultne Iuppiter unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis? Troiani ex Troia venerunt. Aut probatne Iuppiter populos miscere? Aut probatne foedera iungere?"
**Changes:**
*   The single complex sentence containing indirect questions with subjunctive verbs (`velit`, `probet`) was broken into several shorter sentences.
*   The indirect questions were changed into a direct statement of ignorance ("Ego nescio") followed by direct questions using indicative verbs (`Vultne...?`, `probatne...?`).
*   The participle `profectis` (modifying an implied "Troianis," meaning "for those having set out from Troy") was replaced with a simple statement: "Troiani ex Troia venerunt" ("The Trojans came from Troy").
*   The passive infinitives `misceri` ("to be mixed") and `iungi` ("to be joined") were changed to active infinitives `miscere` ("to mix") and `iungere` ("to join"), governed by `probatne`.

**Original line 4 (Venus speaking):** "tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando."
**Simplified version:** "Tu es uxor Iovis. Te decet animum eius temptare. Tu eum precibus tuis movere potes."
**Changes:**
*   The concise `tu coniunx` ("you, his wife") was expanded to `Tu es uxor Iovis` ("You are Jupiter's wife") for clarity.
*   The impersonal expression `tibi fas [est]` ("it is right for you") was replaced with the personal construction `Te decet` ("It is fitting for you / You should").
*   The gerund `precando` ("by praying") was replaced by a clause with an ablative of means: `Tu eum precibus tuis movere potes` ("You are able to move him with your prayers"). This was split into a separate sentence for simplicity.

**Original line 5 (Venus speaking):** "perge, sequar.”
**Simplified version:** "Age! Ego te iuvabo."
**Changes:**
*   The imperative `perge` ("Proceed!") was rendered with the common imperative `Age!` ("Come on! / Go on!").
*   The deponent future verb `sequar` ("I will follow") was replaced with the active future verb `iuvabo` in the phrase `Ego te iuvabo` ("I will help you"), which expresses Venus's support for Juno's initiative.

**Original lines 5-6 (Juno responding):** "tum sic excepit regia Iuno: / “mecum erit iste labor."
**Simplified version:** "Tum regina Iuno sic respondit: / 'Ego istud opus faciam.'"
**Changes:**
*   The verb `excepit` ("she replied / took up") was simplified to `respondit` ("she replied").
*   The phrase `mecum erit iste labor` ("that task will be with me," meaning "it will be my responsibility") was rephrased more directly as `Ego istud opus faciam` ("I will do that task/work").

**Original lines 6-7 (Juno speaking):** "nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo."
**Simplified version:** "Nunc tibi consilium meum paucis verbis monstrabo. (Tu animum adverte!) Hoc consilium est de re necessaria. Docebo te quomodo hoc facere possumus."
**Changes:**
*   The dense indirect question `qua ratione quod instat confieri possit` ("by what method that which is imminent/pressing can be accomplished") was broken down into simpler parts across multiple sentences.
*   `quod instat` (a substantive relative clause, "that which is at hand") is referred to more concretely: `Hoc consilium est de re necessaria` ("This plan is about a necessary matter").
*   The passive infinitive `confieri` ("to be accomplished") with the subjunctive `possit` ("it might be possible") was replaced by an indirect question with an active, indicative verb: `Docebo te quomodo hoc facere possumus` ("I will teach you how we can do this").
*   The parenthetical imperative `adverte` ("Pay attention!") was expanded to the more common student phrase `Tu animum adverte!` ("Pay attention!").
*   `docebo` ("I will teach") is retained, and `monstrabo` ("I will show") is also used to convey the explanation.

**Original lines 8-9 (Juno speaking):** "venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant,"
**Simplified version:** "Aeneas et miserrima Dido simul parant. Volunt ire in silvam. Ibi animalia capient."
**Changes:**
*   The supine `venatum` ("to hunt"), indicating purpose, was removed. Instead, the purpose of their going to the woods is stated in a separate, simple sentence: `Ibi animalia capient` ("There they will catch animals").
*   `unaque` ("and together") was simplified to `simul` ("together").
*   The core idea `Aeneas ... Dido ... in nemus ire parant` ("Aeneas and Dido prepare to go into the grove") is maintained but broken into two sentences: `Aeneas et miserrima Dido simul parant. Volunt ire in silvam.` ("Aeneas and very wretched Dido prepare together. They want to go into the forest."). `Nemus` (grove) was simplified to the more common `silvam` (forest).

**Original lines 9-10 (Juno speaking):** "ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem."
**Simplified version:** "Hoc facient ubi cras Sol primum lumen tollet et radiis suis mundum ostendet."
**Changes:**
*   The future perfect indicative verbs `extulerit` ("will have brought forth") and `retexerit` ("will have uncovered") were changed to simpler future indicative verbs `tollet` ("will raise") and `ostendet` ("will show").
*   `Titan` (a poetic name for the Sun) was replaced with the more common `Sol` ("Sun").
*   `primos ortus extulerit` ("will have brought forth [his] first risings") was simplified to `primum lumen tollet` ("will raise the first light").
*   `radiisque retexerit orbem` ("and with [his] rays will have uncovered the world") was simplified to `radiis suis mundum ostendet` ("will show the world with his rays").
*   The simplified clause is introduced by "Hoc facient ubi..." ("They will do this when...") to clearly link it to the previously mentioned action of Aeneas and Dido going to the woods.
