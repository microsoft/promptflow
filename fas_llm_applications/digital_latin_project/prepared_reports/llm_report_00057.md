Here is the simplified passage:

Venus dicit:
"Sed ego sum incerta propter fata.
Consilia Iovis non intellego.
Fortasse Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis qui ex Troia fugerunt.
Aut fortasse Iuppiter probat si populi inter se miscentur.
Aut fortasse probat si homines foedera iungunt.
Tu es uxor Iovis.
Tibi licet animum Iovis tuis precibus temptare.
Age! Ego tuo consilio parebo."

Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:
"Hic labor meus erit.
Nunc paucis verbis (Attende!) tibi exponam quomodo hoc negotium fieri potest.
Aeneas et miserrima Dido parant simul ire in silvam.
Ibi animalia capere volunt.
Hoc fiet cras, quando Sol primum lumen ostendet et radiis suis mundum aperiet."

Here is a description of the changes made:

**Original line/sentence:** `sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam / esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis, / miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi.`
*   **Simplification:**
    *   `Sed ego sum incerta propter fata.`
    *   `Consilia Iovis non intellego.`
    *   `Fortasse Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis qui ex Troia fugerunt.`
    *   `Aut fortasse Iuppiter probat si populi inter se miscentur.`
    *   `Aut fortasse probat si homines foedera iungunt.`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   The deponent verb `feror` was changed to the active `sum incerta`.
    *   The indirect questions with subjunctive verbs (`si Iuppiter unam esse velit`, `miscerive probet`) were rephrased. Venus's uncertainty is stated directly (`Consilia Iovis non intellego`), and Jupiter's potential wishes are expressed using `fortasse` with indicative verbs (`vult`, `probat`).
    *   The participle `profectis` (those who set out) was replaced with a relative clause `qui ex Troia fugerunt` (who fled from Troy) for clarity.
    *   The passive infinitives in the indirect question (`misceri`, `iungi`) were changed to indicative verbs in `si` clauses (`si populi inter se miscentur`, `si homines foedera iungunt`). The sentence was broken into several shorter sentences for simplicity.

**Original line/sentence:** `tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando.`
*   **Simplification:**
    *   `Tu es uxor Iovis.`
    *   `Tibi licet animum Iovis tuis precibus temptare.`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   `coniunx` was clarified as `uxor Iovis` (wife of Jupiter).
    *   `fas [est]` was simplified to `licet` (it is permitted).
    *   The gerund `precando` (by praying) was replaced with the ablative noun phrase `tuis precibus` (with your prayers).

**Original line/sentence:** `perge, sequar.”`
*   **Simplification:** `Age! Ego tuo consilio parebo.”`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   `perge` (go on!) was simplified to `Age!` (Come now! / Go on!).
    *   The deponent verb `sequar` (I will follow) was replaced with the non-deponent `parebo` (I will obey) with `tuo consilio` (your plan).

**Original line/sentence:** `tum sic excepit regia Iuno:`
*   **Simplification:** `Tum regia Iuno sic respondit:`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   The verb `excepit` (she took up / replied) was simplified to `respondit` (she replied).

**Original line/sentence:** `“mecum erit iste labor.`
*   **Simplification:** `“Hic labor meus erit."`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   The phrase `mecum erit iste labor` (that task will be with me) was simplified to `Hic labor meus erit` (This task will be mine).

**Original line/sentence:** `nunc qua ratione quod instat / confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo.`
*   **Simplification:** `Nunc paucis verbis (Attende!) tibi exponam quomodo hoc negotium fieri potest.`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   The indirect question `qua ratione ... confieri possit` (by what means ... could be accomplished), which used a subjunctive (`possit`) and a passive infinitive `confieri`, was simplified to `quomodo hoc negotium fieri potest` (how this business can be done), using an indicative verb (`potest`).
    *   `quod instat` (that which is pressing/at hand) was simplified to `hoc negotium` (this business/task).
    *   `docebo` (I will teach) was changed to `exponam` (I will explain).
    *   `adverte` (pay attention!) was changed to `Attende!` (Listen! / Pay attention!). The parenthetical placement was maintained.

**Original line/sentence:** `venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido / in nemus ire parant,`
*   **Simplification:**
    *   `Aeneas et miserrima Dido parant simul ire in silvam.`
    *   `Ibi animalia capere volunt.`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   The supine `venatum` (to hunt, from the deponent `venor`) with `ire` was replaced by the active construction `animalia capere volunt` (they want to catch animals), with `ire in silvam` (to go into the forest) stated in the preceding sentence.
    *   `unaque` (and together) was conveyed by `simul` (together).
    *   `nemus` (grove, wood) was simplified to `silvam` (forest).
    *   The original line was split into two simpler sentences for clarity.

**Original line/sentence:** `ubi primos crastinus ortus / extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem.`
*   **Simplification:** `Hoc fiet cras, quando Sol primum lumen ostendet et radiis suis mundum aperiet.`
*   **Summary of changes:**
    *   The temporal clause `ubi ... extulerit ... retexerit` (when ... will have brought forth ... and will have uncovered), using future perfect verbs, was simplified to a `quando` clause with simple future indicative verbs (`ostendet`, `aperiet`).
    *   `Titan` (the Sun god) was simplified to `Sol` (Sun).
    *   `primos crastinus ortus extulerit` (tomorrow's [sun] will have brought forth its first risings) was simplified to `Sol primum lumen ostendet` (the Sun will show its first light).
    *   `radiisque retexerit orbem` (and with its rays will have uncovered the world) was simplified to `et radiis suis mundum aperiet` (and with its rays will open/reveal the world).
    *   `Hoc fiet cras` (This will happen tomorrow) was added for context and to introduce the temporal clause.
