Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to simplify a Latin passage for first-year students. The original text is from the Aeneid, I think. Let me start by reading through the original lines to understand the key points.

First, the lines mention fate, Jupiter, the Tyrians and Trojans, mixing peoples, treaties, Juno speaking to someone (maybe Venus?), a hunt with Aeneas and Dido, and the next day's sunrise. The user's instructions say to avoid complex grammar structures like subjunctives, participles, deponents, etc. So I need to rephrase each part using simple sentences and high-frequency vocabulary.

Looking at the first line: "sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis," The key ideas are uncertainty due to fate, Jupiter wanting one city for Tyrians and Trojans. The verb "feror" is passive, which might be okay unless it's impersonal. "incerta" is a participle, so I need to replace that. Maybe "non certa sum" instead. "si Iuppiter unam urbem velit" uses subjunctive, so change to future or present indicative. Maybe "si Iuppiter unam urbem vult."

Next line: "miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi." "probet" is subjunctive, so change to indicative. "misceri" is passive infinitive, which is allowed. So "an populos miscere probat aut foedera iungi." Then, "tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando. perge, sequar.” Here, "temptare precando" uses a gerund, which is forbidden. Replace with a purpose clause using "ut" and a subjunctive, but subjunctives are not allowed. Hmm, maybe "tibi licet animam temptare precibus. perge, ego te sequar."

Juno's response: “mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo." "possit" is subjunctive, so change to "potest." "adverte" is imperative, which is okay. "docebo" is future, fine. So "nunc qua ratione quod
