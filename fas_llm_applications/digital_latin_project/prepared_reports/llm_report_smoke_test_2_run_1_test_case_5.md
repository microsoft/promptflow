Here is the simplified passage:

sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam  
esse vult Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,  
miscere probat populos aut foedera iungi.  
tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando.  
perge, sequam.” tum sic excepit regia Iuno:  
“mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat  
confieri potest, paucis (adverte) docebo.  
venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido  
in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus  
extollet Titan radiisque retexet orbem.

Reasoning Content:

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to simplify a Latin passage for second-year students. First, I need to analyze the original text. Let's look at the lines from the Aeneid provided.

The passage involves dialogue between characters, probably Dido and Aeneas, with Juno intervening. Key points: uncertainty of fate, Jupiter's will regarding the Tyrians and Trojans joining, the plan to hunt, and Juno's involvement.

Now, checking for forbidden structures. The original has subjunctives like "feror" (if that's subjunctive?), "velit", "probet", "iungi" (passive infinitive?), "temptare", "sequar", "excepit", "possit", "adverte", "extulerit", "retexerit". Also, "miscerive" is a gerundive? Wait, "miscerive" is a contraction of "miscere + -ve", so it's an infinitive. Maybe not a gerundive. Let me confirm. "probet populos aut foedera iungi" – "iungi" is passive infinitive, which is allowed? The rules say to replace subjunctives, gerunds, gerundives, supines, impersonal passives, double datives.

So, the task is to replace subjunctives with indicatives or other constructions. Let's go line by line.

"sed fatis incerta feror" – "feror" is present passive, but "incerta" is feminine, so the subject is Dido. Maybe rephrase to "feror" as passive, but not sure if that's an issue. The user said to avoid impersonal passives, but this is personal. So maybe okay.

"si Iuppiter unam esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis" – "velit" is subjunctive. Replace with "vult" indicative. "Tyriis" dative, "Troiaque profectis" dative. So "if Jupiter wants there to be one city for the Tyrians and those who set out from Troy."

"miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi." – "probet" subjunctive, change to "probat". "iungi" passive infinitive, maybe replace with active if possible. "aut foedera iungi" – "or that treaties be joined" → "aut foedera iunguntur" (present passive) or find an active construction. Maybe "aut ut foedera iungant" but that's subjunctive again. Hmm. Alternatively, "aut foedera iungere" as infinitive, but the original uses "probet" with infinitive? Wait, "probet" is subjunctive in original, so "approves to mix the peoples or that treaties be joined." Changing "probet" to "probat" and "iungi" to "iungere" (active infinitive) might not make sense. Maybe rephrase the entire clause.

"tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando." – "temptare" is infinitive, which is okay. "fas" is impersonal, but the user didn't mention that as forbidden. Maybe keep.

"perge, sequar.” – "sequar" is future or present subjunctive? It's future indicative: "I will follow." Wait, "sequar" is 1st person singular future indicative of "sequor". So that's allowed. No subjunctive here.

"tum sic excepit regia Iuno" – "excepit" is perfect indicative, okay.

"mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo." – "possit" is subjunctive. Change to "potest". "adverte" is imperative, allowed.

"venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem." – "extulerit" and "retexerit" are future perfect indicatives. Wait, future perfect is allowed. So no problem. But maybe students haven't learned future perfect yet. The user didn't specify, but the rules say to avoid subjunctives, etc. Since future perfect is indicative, it's allowed. So maybe keep.

Now, reconstructing each line with substitutions:

Original: "sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis, miscerive probet populos aut foedera iungi."

Simplified: Replace "velit" with "vult", "probet" with "probat", "iungi" with "iunguntur" (present passive). So: "sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam esse vult Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis, miscere probat populos aut foedera iunguntur."

But "miscerive" is "miscere + -ve", so "aut miscere probat populos". Maybe rephrase to "aut probat populos misceri aut foedera iungi" but that uses passive infinitives. Alternatively, "aut populos miscet aut foedera iungit" – but that changes meaning. Hmm. Maybe keep the structure but adjust the verbs.

Alternatively: "si Iuppiter vult unam urbem esse Tyriis et Troianis profectis, et probat populos misceri aut foedera iungi." But "probat" with infinitive is okay? Maybe. But the original uses "miscerive probet" – "approves to mix or to join". So maybe "probat miscere populos aut iungere foedera." But "miscere" is active infinitive, which would mean "approves to mix the peoples or to join treaties." That might work.

Next line: "tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando. perge, sequar.” – Keep as is, since "temptare" is infinitive, "perge" imperative, "sequar" future indicative.

Juno's response: "mecum erit iste labor. nunc qua ratione quod instat confieri possit, paucis (adverte) docebo." – Change "possit" to "potest". So: "nunc qua ratione quod instat confieri potest, paucis (adverte) docebo."

Last lines: "venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus extulerit Titan radiisque retexerit orbem." – Future perfects are okay, but maybe replace with future simple for simplicity. "extulerit" → "extollet", "retexerit" → "retexet". So: "ubi primos crastinus ortus extollet Titan radiisque retexet orbem."

Putting it all together, making sure the dialogue parts are preserved, speakers are correct, and no forbidden structures. Let me check each part again for subjunctives, gerunds, etc. Also, ensure sentences don't have more than two dependent clauses.

Final simplified passage should maintain all key ideas without adding or omitting anything. Let me verify each line again.
