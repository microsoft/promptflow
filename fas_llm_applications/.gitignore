# PromptFlow's internal metadata/cache for flows
# These are generated by the PromptFlow UI/CLI and generally not relevant for committing,
# except for flow.tools.json which is needed for Azure ML component integration.
# The main PromptFlow project also ignores these files, with the same exception.
digital_latin_project/flows/**/.promptflow/
# Re-include flow.tools.json as it's often required for Azure ML integration
!digital_latin_project/flows/**/.promptflow/flow.tools.json

# NOTE: We are *intentionally* not ignoring .log or .txt files anywhere,
# and are explicitly including all contents of 'results/' and 'prepared_reports/'
# for now, as we are still in the process of understanding PromptFlow behavior
# and using the repo as a temporary data store for outputs.
# If these folders or file types were to be ignored later, specific rules would be added here.

# Example: If we later decide to ignore *all* JSON results, but still keep logs and reports:
# digital_latin_project/results/*.json
# digital_latin_project/prepared_reports/*.json
