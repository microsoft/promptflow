**Prompt flow** is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development cycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As the momentum for LLM-based AI applications continues to grow across the globe, prompt flow provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process of prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and deploying your AI applications. 

With prompt flow, you will be able to: 

- Create executable flows that link LLMs, prompts, and Python tools through a visualized graph. 
- Debug, share, and iterate your flows with ease through team collaboration. 
- Create prompt variants and evaluate their performance through large-scale testing. 
- Deploy a real-time endpoint that unlocks the full power of LLMs for your application. 

You can develope your flow locally and seamlessly move the experience to azure cloud, learn more: [Azure Machine Learning prompt flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/overview-what-is-prompt-flow?view=azureml-api-2).

By joining the Prompt Flow community, you can build AI-first apps faster and have a front-row
peek at how the SDK is being built. Prompt Flow has been released as open-source so that more
pioneering developers can join us in crafting the future of how people building AI applications.
