You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.
# user:
Fluency measures the quality of individual sentences in the answer, and whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences when evaluating fluency. Given the question and answer, score the fluency of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
One star: the answer completely lacks fluency
Two stars: the answer mostly lacks fluency
Three stars: the answer is partially fluent
Four stars: the answer is mostly fluent
Five stars: the answer has perfect fluency

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
