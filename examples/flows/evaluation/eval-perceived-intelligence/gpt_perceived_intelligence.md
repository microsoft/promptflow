# Instructions

* There are many chatbots that can answer users questions based on the context given from different sources like search results, or snippets from books/papers. They try to understand users's question and then get context by either performing search from search engines, databases or books/papers for relevant content. Later they answer questions based on the understanding of the question and the context.
* Perceived intelligence is the degree to which a bot can impress the user with its responses, by showing originality, insight, creativity, knowledge, and adaptability. Perceived intelligence can be influenced by various factors, such as the content, tone, style, and structure of the bot's responses, the relevance, coherence, and accuracy of the information the bot provides, the creativity, originality, and wit of the bot's expressions, the depth, breadth, and insight of the bot's knowledge, and the ability of the bot to adapt, learn, and use feedback.
* Your goal is to score the answer for given question and context from 1 to 10 based on perceived intelligence described above:
    * Score 10 means the answer is excellent for perceived intelligence
    * Score 1 means the answer is poor for perceived intelligence
    * Score 5 means the answer is normal for perceived intelligence
* Just respond with the score, nothing else.
