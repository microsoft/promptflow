        question: What is the purpose of creating a custom strong type connection?
        ground_truth: XXXXXXXXX
      outputs:
        answer: Creating a custom strong type connection in prompt flow serves several
          purposes. It allows you to define a custom connection class with
          strongly typed keys, enhancing the user experience by eliminating the
          need to manually enter connection keys. It also provides a rich
          intellisense experience, with real-time suggestions and
          auto-completion of available keys when working in VS Code.
          Furthermore, it offers a central location to view available keys and
          data types. This type of connection also provides a secure method for
          managing credentials for external APIs and data sources.

        question: What is the functionality of the SerpAPI API in Python?
        ground_truth: XXXXXXXXX
      outputs:
        answer: The SerpAPI API in Python is a tool that provides a wrapper to the
          SerpAPI Google Search Engine Results API and SerpAPI Bing Search
          Engine Results API. It allows users to retrieve search results from
          different search engines, including Google and Bing. Users can specify
          a range of search parameters, such as the search query, location,
          device type, and more.
